SOLVEDWell I uninstalled wicd and then turned the card off then on with FN+F11 and it works fine now. Strange.


Network Manager suddenly stopped recognizing my wireless network.
I've tried to reinstall network manager, then I uninstalled and installed wcid but that didn't recognize the network either. I also checked for additional drivers and activated the "software modem" (the smartlink daemon) and I'm kind of a noob so I'm not sure where else to go on this. I followed the steps for network troubleshooting from the documentation and the results are following...
