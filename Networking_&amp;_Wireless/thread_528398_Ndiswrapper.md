If you already have an internet connection (ie a working wired ethernet connection),
please skip to step #4. Without any internet connection, please begin at step #1.

All commands typed at command prompt:

```

   1. After booting into Ubuntu, put the Ubuntu installation CD in drive and wait for it to "spin up"
   2. sudo apt-cdrom add
   3. sudo aptitude update
   4. sudo aptitude install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`
```


OK next we want to download the ndiswrapper source files (Reference URL = _[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482)_)

We are grabbing ndiswrapper-1.48-rc1

***The following section will work if you have an internet connection
*** If you do not have an internet connection, on a different computer you will need to download the ndiswrapper source file from: 
[http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz](http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz)
Please place this on a flash drive (USB Flash drive), transfer it to the Ubuntu machine, and then place it in the ~/ndiswrapper directory.  Continue with the next following set of instructions
```
cd ~
mkdir ndiswrapper
wget http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz -O ~/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz 
cd ndiswrapper

```

Extract, compile, and install ndiswrapper
```
tar -zxvf ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz
cd ndiswrapper-1.48rc1
make distclean
make
sudo make install
```

Verify installation with
```
ndiswrapper -v
```

The output should be something like the following:
```

utils version: '1.9', utils version needed by module: '1.9'
module details:
filename:       /lib/modules/2.6.20-16-generic/misc/ndiswrapper.ko
version:        1.48rc1
vermagic:       2.6.20-16-generic SMP mod_unload 586

```

Next create and place your Window's wireless driver into ~/driver:
```
cd ~
mkdir driver
cd driver
```

Ensuring the ***.sys and ***.inf file for the Window's driver are in the~/driver directory:
```
sudo ndiswrapper -i *****.inf
```

Verify installation with:
```
ndiswrapper -l
```
Make sure no errors are reported and you get something like:
> 
bcmwl5: driver installed
device (14E4:4320) present


Ok, to insert the ndiswrapper module into the linux kernel:
```
sudo depmod -a
```

Ensure you dont get any errors when running this command.  Then:
```
sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
```

To verify there wasnt any errors:
```
dmesg
```
and look for something like:
> ndiswrapper version *version* loaded

Next lets make an alias for wlan0 associated with ndiswrapper
```
sudo ndiswrapper -m
```

And ensure that the ndiswrapper module is loaded at boot:
```
echo "ndiswrapper" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

I recommend rebooting at this time.
```
sudo shutdown -r now
```

Additional modifications may be needed to your /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/iftab files, since the wireless interface we are know using is going to be known as wlan0, and not eth0, eth1, ath0, etc.  Im not sure how your previous setup was configured, hence possibly the need to further alter these files.  I also recommend that you turn off any router encryption (WEP,WPA), and any MAC filtering at the router for the time being until we can verify basic connectivity.  We can build these complexities into the setup once everything is up and running
