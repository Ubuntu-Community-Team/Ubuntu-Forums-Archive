Hi guys,

I posted this similiar thread in the general forum and realised that I may get my question answered in here as its more appropriate so please excuse the double post as I didnt know this forum existed.

I have just installed gutsy, I'm a ubuntu newbie
Yesterday i was able to install some programs through synaptic manager, after changing the download servers a few times.

Today I am unable to download a thing, after trying multiple download servers?

'file /etc/apt/sources.list'

deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 7.10 _Gutsy Gibbon_ - Release i386 (20071016)]/ gutsy main restricted

Hmmm.. I just downloaded and installed 'bluefish' through synaptic and then tried to search for another program to install and the download failed. My internet then went?

I restarted the wireless connection, the icon showed that it was trying to connect, it failed. I clicked it and it connected.

Any ideas what I can do to resolve this?
I have to keep selecting a download source / download site  :(

It looks like all of the repos are commented out except for one. 
In case you didn't know, or for the benefit of others, the # sign in a config file or script tells the shell to disregard everything to the right of the #. Same goes for the ; sign. 
It sounds like you already know how to edit this file, so just remove the # sign on the repos you wish to use!

edit: Oops, just caught this-

Not sure what the deal is there-gpg authentication issue maybe?

I managed to edit the sources list however...

Synaptic Manager is still failing. I am having to change servers till I find one that doesnt fail, very long process to download a single program!
