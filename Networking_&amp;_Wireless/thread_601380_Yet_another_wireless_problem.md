Im so confused. I know I got Broadcom 4321AG 802.11a/b/g/draft-n Wi-Fi Adapter, I know I got WPA but  I dont know WPA1 or 2 or wtf. I got Ubuntu 7.10 with no working wireless. I got an HP Pavillion dv9000. I've been reading my *** of on tutorials but I still know how to get it work. Would anyone please do an private help thing with me? I am so lost and so addicted to get ubuntu to work out correctly! Maybe it will pay back too...

Is your wireless card.  You probably want to read this...

It is a howto on getting your particular brand of card working.

I have read the guide, but since it says something about WPA and yet another guide with information I dont know, I dont get any further.

Get the driver working first, then you can use networkmanager which will sort out everything for you
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper)
To get your driver working.

Ive installed with the Desktop CD and that is for the Alternate CD+ I got Gutsy Gibbon...

### Post by kevdog on 2007-11-18
in your lshw statement you dont have the driver installed for the device.  you will need to do ndiswrapper since broadcom 4328 cards are not supported with the builtin bcm43xx driver

---

### Post by Kurenai0h on 2007-11-18
Okey how do I do that?

This is your card:
03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4328 802.11a/b/g/n (rev 03)

You need the windows xp drivers either from disc or from the linksys website (or whatever brand you are using).  You spefically want the ****.sys and ***.inf files from the xp driver package.  Im not sure but likely the driver files will be name something like bcmwl5.inf bcmwl5.sys.   Then follow either one of these two guides:

Check his signature, it looks like a good guide.

With my old laptop I had a wifi dongle that needed to use ndiswrapper and if you follow the guide you will compile the latest version which can be a very important detail in getting full use (WPA etc included) of your wifi.

You will need to acquire the ndiswrapper source tarball. Can you plug in a wired connection to the internet so that you can download it, or get the source via a usb pen drive?

---

### Post by Kurenai0h on 2007-11-18
I forgot to say, I got Vista so I guess I have to do something else then, kevdog? I can bring my laptop over to a friend that got wire, but I got no pen, is it possible to just use my mobile?

---

### Post by kevdog on 2007-11-18
Its ok if you have Vista -- you just need the windows xp drivers (can get from manufacturer's website).  You basically need to do the following and since you have a working internet connection with Vista take advantage of it.

#1 - The ubuntu installation cd -- use this to install the build-essential and linux-headers packages as explained in the second guide

#2 - A working internet connection - to download the xp drivers and the ndiswrapper.tar.gz source package.  Burn these two packages to a disc, floppy, usb stick, or whatever medium and bring this over to the ubuntu installation.  

Thats basically all the downloading or outside packages you need.  Just start typing a bunch of commands and you should be good to go.  Do you know if you are trying to use the bcmwl5 or bcmwl6 driver??

---

### Post by Kurenai0h on 2007-11-19
Ill try this, but I have no idea of where to get the xp drivers... about bcmwl5 or bcmwl6 driver I have no idea what that is. With no working connection, can I do this phase then? 
Code:

cd ~
mkdir ndiswrapper
wget [http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48.tar.gz](http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48.tar.gz) -O ~/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48.tar.gz 
cd ndiswrapper

Extract ndiswrapper
Code:

tar -zxvf ndiswrapper-1.48.tar.gz
cd ndiswrapper-1.48


*** SVN version of ndiswrapper - An alternative installation method for those with existing ethernet connection
For those wanting to live on the edge and use the most recent beta release of ndiswrapper, this package can be download from the svn repository.
Install the subversion package
Code:

 sudo aptitude install subversion

Download the ndiswrapper svn package
Code:

cd ~
mkdir ndiswrapper
cd ndiswrapper
mkdir ndiswrapper-svn
svn co co [https://ndiswrapper.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ndiswrapper/trunk/ndiswrapper](https://ndiswrapper.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ndiswrapper/trunk/ndiswrapper) ndiswrapper-svn
cd ndiswrapper-svn

***

The remainder of the steps are applicable to all ndiswrapper installation methods
Compile and Install ndiswrapper
Code:

make distclean
make
sudo make install

Or do I need to jump down the stuff below?

I dont understand this one: Ensuring the ***.sys and ***.inf file for the Window's driver are in the~/driver directory:
Code:

sudo ndiswrapper -i *****.inf

Do I need to fill anything else in where you put the stars? And in that case where do I find what to put in?

Another thing is, it's my dad that is running the whole net thing and we got WPA and I have no idea of how to turn it off, so Ill need a little help there too, I guess.

Take a look at this guide:
[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=475963](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=475963)

This will help you with the driver selection.

### Post by Kurenai0h on 2007-11-19
Okey I got the driver now! :D What I need to know now is where to start in this guide: [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=574501](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=574501)

Ok, the first guide you either need the ndiswrapper tar ball (.tar.gz file) or you need an internet connection to download the svn version from the online repository.

If you grab the tar.gz you simply need to extract, compile and install the program.
The wget statement if you read the instructions closely is like ftp (but only works with an internet connection).  You can get the very latest tar.gz file from here:
[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.50rc1.tar.gz?modtime=1195125400&big_mirror=0](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.50rc1.tar.gz?modtime=1195125400&big_mirror=0)


Basically do the following to extract and compile and then install ndiswrapper:
```
cd ~
tar zxvf ndiswrapper-1.50rc1.tar.gz
cd ndiswrapper-1.50rc1
make distclean
make 
sudo make install
```

That is it -- for the ndiswrapper installation part.

Then you need to install the drivers inside ndiswrapper, and add the ndiswrapper kernel module inside the kernel.

Start reading the guide from here:

Verify installation with
```

ndiswrapper -v
```

The output should be something similar to the following (svn version may differ slightly):

```

utils version: '1.9', utils version needed by module: '1.9'
module details:
filename:       /lib/modules/2.6.20-16-generic/misc/ndiswrapper.ko
version:        1.48
vermagic:       2.6.20-16-generic SMP mod_unload 586
```

Next create and place your Window's wireless driver into ~/driver:
