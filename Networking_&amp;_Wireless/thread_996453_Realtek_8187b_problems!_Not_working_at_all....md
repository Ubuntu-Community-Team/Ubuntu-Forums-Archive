Hi! Thanks for reading this post. 

[B]Ubuntu 8.04
Computer: Satellite A215-S5824[/B]

I have a big problem, I managed to install the ATI drivers and everything is fine right now, except for the wireless drivers. I read many blogs and posts and I have ndiswrapper installed, my device is Realtek 8187b. I have used **lspci** and i just get this:

So I saw that there was no Realtek Wireless in there. I used another command then, **lsusb** and I got this:

- - - -

xaviermerino@xaviermerino-laptop:~$ lsusb

That's my device! But I can't manage to get it working. Using the ndiswrapper I installed the driver but it doesnt work. It says **hardware present: yes**

So... please help!!! Im new to ubuntu but I don't know how to use the wireless. I forgot to mention Im using Wicd.

Thanks in advance,
Xavier Merino
