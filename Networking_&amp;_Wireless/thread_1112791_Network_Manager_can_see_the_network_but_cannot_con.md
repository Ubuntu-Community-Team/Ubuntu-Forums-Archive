Hello,

I had my wireless card working for some time now, but ever since about a week ago, it suddenly stopped working. Network Manager gets stuck on the message "Requesting a network address from the wireless network 'ACTIONTEC(the name of my router)'" then asks me to authenticate again. I assume it is caused by a recent update, but I am unsure. 

I thought it might be a problem in WEP, as I updated my router firmware about a month before the issue. So I then switched it to WPA encryption, and it gave me the same problem, only asking me to authenticate with WPA. I removed the password completely, thinking maybe it was my error all along, only as it attempted to connect it gave me the same 'Requesting network address' message, then it gave up connecting. I had MadWifi installed, so I reinstalled it shortly after the issue started, and however the same issue persists. If it makes a difference, I believe that 'iwconfig' is supposed to show my wireless card as 'ath0', but it shows it as 'wlan0'. I have it installed through ndiswrapper. I don't believe that it's an issue with nm-applet, because DCPH doesn't connect either. I've tried Google with little help, however.

My computer is a Toshiba Satellite A215-S5837. My wireless card is an Atheros AR5007.
