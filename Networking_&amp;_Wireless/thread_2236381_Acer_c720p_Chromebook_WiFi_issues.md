Hello, all. To keep things breif, wireless is not working on my Chromebook at all. 

I was running Linux Mint originally,  and everything worked fine, however after a while, it all of a sudden could not connect to any wireless network. I've tried installing regular Ubuntu and now xubuntu, but I still can't connect to the internet.

My computer can scan and see the wireless networks in my area, but when I click on them and enter in the credentials (on multiple networks,  which I know are all right), it will just pause for a bit and say it disconnected or failed to connect. What can I do??

**rfkill list**

The wifi on my c720 has never NOT worked, but I have gotten it into odd configurations that needed help of wicd-curses to resolve.

Mine, out of nowhere, stopped working at ALL. Again, it can see networks, it just refuses to connect to any of them, and this thing does not have an ethernet port, so things have been difficult to try and troubleshoot.... 

I'm poor, I have classes starting again in a month, and my laptop's broken. :(

Either the wifi is broken or turned off - what did **rfkill** show?

I use a USB3-to-ethernet adapter [http://www.amazon.com/Unitek-Bus-Powered-Converter-Ultrabooks-Compatible/dp/B00EHDNAOE/](http://www.amazon.com/Unitek-Bus-Powered-Converter-Ultrabooks-Compatible/dp/B00EHDNAOE/) most of the time. GigE is soooooo verrrrrrry much better than wifi.  The driver is built-into 14.04, but wasn't in 13.10.

Rfkill list showed nothing being disabled...

So, I was trying to disable wireless powersave as recommended here: [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1844722](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1844722), but after trying to enter [COLOR=#000000]"sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off"  into terminal, it gave me a message saying "Error for wireless request "Set Power Management" (8B2C) : SET failed on device wlan0 ; Operation not supported." [/COLOR]:confused: This seems odd, as iw dev definitely shows wlan0 as a device. IDK if this can help anyone figure out what's wrong here. AGHHHH!! ](*,)

So, I just borrowed a USB to ethernet adapter from a friend, and even that won't connect. Seriously, what the hell??!?!

Drivers?  The specific chip inside the USB-adapter matters much.  Thought that i'd provided an exact link to a model known to work - assuming the built-in wifi is fried.  Of course, I'd get it fixed under warranty (many CCs double the warranty).

Too bad the rfkill didn't show an easy fix.
What do the log files show related to wifi adapter warnings/errors?

Also ... do all the other wifi devices still work with the wifi-router?  Good to rule out the router as the issue.

BTW - I haven't had any battery concerns at all - 7+ hours of use consistent - I have BT disabled and don't do anything special to control wifi.  Once It got close to dead at a conference with 400 other people, but I was compiling code and taking notes all day.

The WiFi is a pluggable model usb2-e100

And COULD I get it replaced with warranty? I thought breaking that safety sticker to remove the write protection screw and all of that voided my warranty. And I've had this thing for less than 2 months, but I don't have the receipt.

Please follow the instructions in this post to download and run 'wireless_script' (experimental version) and post back the report it generates : [http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=13024222](http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=13024222)

While posting the outputs, please use '**Code**' tags. It preserves the output's formatting and makes the post cleaner, compact and more readable. To see a quick 'HowTo' with screenshots, please follow the "Use Code Tags" link in my signature.

The usb Ethernet adapter you mentioned should work with Linux, without requiring to do anything manually other than plugging it in. Is DHCP configured properly in the router and the cable is a tested one?

Can't wait to see the script output.  Especially the "route" output.

So... I'm running xubuntu, so the steps didn't quite make sense, but I was able to run the script with 
```

sudo /bin/bash wireless_script

```

but the wireless-info.txt file it generated is literally just **a blank text file**... ](*,)

Use the regular script then, mentioned in the original instructions post : [http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=12350385](http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=12350385)

You need nameservers and disabling the hardware encryption of the driver:

```
echo -e "nameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf
echo "options ath9k nohwcrypt=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf
sudo modprobe -rfv ath9k
sudo modprobe -v ath9k
```

After entering in the commands you mentioned, the wireless and the usb-ethernet adapter continue not to work, before and after restarting. :confused:

There's got to be some kind of way where I can issue a log of everything that's going on when I'm trying to connect to a wireless network so we can pinpoint exactly what is going wrong and where???

Check the logs:

```
egrep -i 'net|eth|wlan|firm|reason' /var/log/syslog 
```

and

```
dmesg | egrep 'net|eth|sky|sun|sis|via|3c3|3c5|e100|8139|8169|acx|air|ath|atl|ar9|carl|atme|at7|herm|iwl|ipw|rtl8|r81|rt2|rt3|rt6|rt7|tg3|ssb|wl|b43|b44|ori|pri|p5|zd|ndis|wmi|ns8|FW'

bumping (if that works, here...)

SO, I have an update...

I actually tried to install a non-ubuntu based distro (Fedora), and the wireless works. WTF.

Why would it not work for all of the ubuntu-based distros I tried???

Looks like a network-manager issue. Deactivate IPv6 in your profile ("Ignore").

What was the resolution of this problem?

I have two acer C720s and have managed to kill the wifi on both. Same problem as described previously. Internal wifi no longer works. External USB wifi does not work either.

I tried "Ignore" in IPV6 and it did not solve the problem.

In further experimentation, I discovered that somehow the time/date was messed up (in 22nd century). When I corrected it, the wifi returned on both C720s.

Thank you for posting this follow up. I had the same issue with my chromebook and changing the date/time also fixed it.
