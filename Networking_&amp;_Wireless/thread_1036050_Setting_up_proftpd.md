1. I am behind two routers one ADSL and other WIFI router, however the ADSL router is set in bridge mode so its the WIFI router that matters, 

2. I am behind NAT in the wifi with my pc connected to the wired interface of the wifi router.

3. Port number 20~21 has been forwarded to my local ip.

4. proftpd has been setup and here is the proftpd.conf file,

```

#
# /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf -- This is a basic ProFTPD configuration file.
# To really apply changes reload proftpd after modifications.

The NAT thing has been taken care of and when i use the command,
 sudo /etc/init.d/proftpd restart it gives me this messege,

```

* Stopping ftp server proftpd                                           [ OK ] 
 * Starting ftp server proftpd                                                  xxxx - 192.168.11.2:21 masquerading as xxx.xx.xx.xxx
                                                                         [ OK ]


```

I can access the ftp server using my local ip in the network but somehow whenever i use my external ip it doesnt show any directory listing.

If i use the ftp -p and use open ip port command it says connection refused when the ip is the external ip.

My host file is here as well,

```

#127.0.1.1	xxxx
127.0.0.1	localhost
192.168.11.2	xxxx

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts

```

The xxx has been intentionally edited. Can you please tell me where I am going or doing wrong in setting up proftpd in the latest Ubuntu 8 release?
