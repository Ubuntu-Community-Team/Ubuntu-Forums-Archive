Hello!  I got Samba to share my files (Ubuntu) on the other computers (windows) in our office LAN.   However, I can't seem to access their shares.  I can see them (Windows PCs) on "network:///" but I get an error "unable to get folder's contents" when I try to open their shared folders.  

Here is my Samba config:
```

#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) 
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentary and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors. 
#

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = MESSAGE2

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
    wins support = yes

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
   dns proxy = no

# What naming service and in what order should we use to resolve host names
# to IP addresses
;   name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
;   bind interfaces only = true



#### Debugging/Accounting ####

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

# Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
   max log size = 1000

# If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
# parameter to 'yes'.
;   syslog only = no

# We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
# should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log

####### Authentication #######

# "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
# in this server for every user accessing the server. See
# /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/Samba3-HOWTO/ServerType.html
# in the samba-doc package for details.

# 'encrypt passwords' in the smb.conf(5) manpage before enabling.

# password database type you are using.

# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.

   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

You need to either add users with smbpasswd or allow guests acces the shares.

The Windows folk can access my Samba shares with no problem.  I can't however access their Windows shared folders from Ubuntu.  Is the problem on my side or on their computers?  If its on their computers, then I will have a lot of PC's to configure tomorrow.  :D

I have the same problem within my LAN. I can't access the files on the Window's machine. Any help would be great

It just got worse without me doing anything.  Now I can't see the PC's in my workgroup.  Any help is appreciated. :)

Update: Solved it.  I had the wrong ip and dns settings for our LAN.

What does that mean? I can access my Windows shares by IP address, but not by NETBIOS names. I use DHCP, so I can't make it a habit of accessing them by IP. Can you explain better how you solved it?

My PC's connection was moved to another router, so my IP and DNS settings were wrong.  They were still set for the previous router.  Because my DNS settings were wrong, I could not access their file shares.

i am able to access files from ubuntu to non-ubuntu with no problems. my non- ubuntu is networked on workgroup basis with no password required bet machines.

however i needed to create user and same smb password for non-ubunut pc to access ubuntu files.

however as i have started using ubuntu more often during a day, i find little issues.

Like dates appearing for files in non-ubuntu pc as 1970 - any help?

Ok. It seems now that I can access the shares directly (smb://comp1/c) but I can't see what shares there are (smb://comp1) except for one computer in the house, which I can see. I'm seeing similar issues between the Windows computers, so it could be unrelaed to the Ubuntu one.
