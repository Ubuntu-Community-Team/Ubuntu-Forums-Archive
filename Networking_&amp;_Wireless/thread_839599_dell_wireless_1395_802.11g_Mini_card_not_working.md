the driver is in the repo now
if you dint install  ndiswrapper then skip steps 2,3,4 
1.Update & upgrade using update-manager/synaptic/adept etc
2.
```

sudo apt-get remove ndisgtk ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-utils-1.9

```
3. Remove the ndiswrapper line from /etc/modules
4. Disable wireless from the network manager applet and then

```
sudo modprobe -r ndiswrapper
```

If it cribs about module being in use, it means you have not disabled wireless
5. Restart, if there were any kernel upgrades
6. System->Administration->Hardware Drivers
I see a wl driver here. Make sure it says enabled and is in use.

worked for me with dell 1395 on inspiron 1525
