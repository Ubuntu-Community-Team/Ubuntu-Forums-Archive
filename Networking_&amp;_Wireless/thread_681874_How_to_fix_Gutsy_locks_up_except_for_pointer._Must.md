title: "How to fix: Gutsy locks up except for pointer. Must do hard reboot."

I installed 7.10 in Nov 07, and it worked with occasional (once a week) locking up.  Usually firefox was running but not always.  The pointer would move but not activate any actions.  All the keyboard commands -- Ctrl+Alt+Up/Dwn, Ctrl+ Alt+Del, etc. -- failed to have any impact.  The usage monitor in my sidebar showed full capacity of the cpu was being used.

Here more recently, the reboots are once every 90 minutes.  I tried using Epiphany to circumvent Firefox, andGutsy promptly locked in it also.  I have searched for solutions, tried some re-installs, etc., but I am at a loss as to how to proceed.

Attached are the tail ends of my log files.

Thanks for any insights you might have.

You can try Ctrl+Alt+SysRq+E to terminate all running process and get your CPU resources back; or try keeping "top" running to see which process if hogging the CPU.

I have faced gutsy lockups typically in certain screensavers, and usually with kubuntu and ubuntu residing together. No more lockups or freezes after removing any one or the other; currently only running gnome/ubuntu and no problems now.

Exactly 90 mins? Or within 90 mins max?

I have also faced problems with flash based websites on Firefox / Epiphany, but no lockups, just high CPU (60-80%) usage by gnash, but have not tried the "restricted" flash driver so cannot really comment on wether it is normal or not. For ref; I have a dual core 1.6 ghz intel cpu / 1Gb.

Cheers,
PRShah

For the record, I experience the same problem although I haven't noticed a certain time constraint.

Are you running the 64bit edition?  I am.  I don't know if it is isolated to just the 64 bit version or not though.

i started having these lockups after two last kernel updates (2.6.22-13 & 2.6.22-14 i believe) my machine locks & only mouse works no keyboard nothing. Been checking logs if there's something but haven't found anything... First time i was doing random surfing & second time my laptop locked when i was closing VLC
i don't use screensaver
32bit version btw.

Add me to the list of folks with this problem.

Dual Athlon system, is everyone with this problem running an MP system?

I the last lockup I had the System Monitor up and it was frozen.

I've tried different memory configurations and graphics cards, I may pull one of the processors to see if the problem goes away.

Up until this install, I've had only great success with Ubuntu. This time around I've fought the BusyBox error and now this.

Geeeze, is MS submitting code to the builds? :(

Same problem here.

HP dv8000 series laptop, centrino dual core, ip3945 wireless, 2.6.22-14-generic kernel.

Not noticed any time pattern though, totally random lockups.

### Post by JamieClay on 2008-02-16
I agree - I've not noticed any particular time interval.

I did remove one of the processors (but at the same time added a USB 2.0 card) and had it lock up right away.  I knew I shouldn't have done two things at once - bad testing approach.

Anyway, it's running right now with just one CPU, I suspect it will lock up. (and it did)

The Ctrl-Alt-E-SysRq did nothing last lockup.

In my testing I have Pandora.com open playing music (so I can hear when it fails, so to speak) and the system monitor open.

The last failure was interesting in that the first sign of trouble was that the monitor would not return from power saver mode, no matter what I did. And yet the music from Firefox/Pandora was playing.

Eventually that stopped - and I should mention that when it locks up I have to press the reset button.  Holding down the power button does not shut the system down.  It will after I've pressed reset.

Whatever is going on here  must be really deep.  

I'm going to install Feisty Fawn (last build I have a CD for) and see if the problem follows.

Compiz is the problem...turn it off completely (for the freezing but having cursor still move problem).

Ok (now that I have Feisty installed) but why? What is Compiz? It would be nice to know more than just 'turn it off' - is there a bulletin on this?

Similar thing happens to me.  I have tracked it to my USB wireless device.  It seems that every once in a while it would crap out (the kernel logs point to the module having some LED error or something) and then everything, except the mouse pointer, becomes unresponsive.  I have to either quickly kill X or reboot to fix it.

Yeah, I've been poking around and haven't seen any single solution posted yet.  

My solution was to revert back to Feisty - that's what solved the problem for me.

Try this:

from[ this thread:]("http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=690546")


Open the /etc/init.d/rc file and search for this line and change it from

CONCURRENCY=shell

to

CONCURRENCY=none

This is the most likely problem if your setting is CONCURRENCY=shell

Hmm, had a look at this file and the concurrency is set to none already.

Possibly related to this problem is the fact that my screen appears to blank every so often.  It just kind of flickers once and then it is ok.  Again there is no pattern, totally random but sometimes the system hangs at the exact same time.

### Post by JamieClay on 2008-02-17
It's looking to me like there's no one solution and considering this has been going on for months, I guess moving back to Feisty was the best move.

I've had the same problem with my Gutsy install, but being a newbie...I can't check the error logs...if there are any.  However, I have noticed that it happens most often when I try to get into a web site via firefox where I'm running into a secure site (like my web based e-mail).  It may not happen right away upon hitting the site, but shortly there after if not immediately the screen/computer locks up except I can still move the mouse pointer around.  I have no way of proving this from my end...i'm a newbie...but if this is also what is causing your problem, maybe it'll help.

I'm running
Gutsy Gibbon (xubuntu)
on a Gateway Solo 2500 (old school)
with a Celeron 333MHz processor
and 192 MB of memory (if I'm remembering right)
Firefox ver. 2.0.0.12
accessing the web from a Zonet 802.11g USB ethernet dongle
through a residential wireless router to broadband.

This is currently the only issue I have with the machine locking up.  I haven't had it do this when I'm word processing or playing around with the games, nor surfing around all day to sites that do not have secure socket connections.

I hope this helps.

This is the exact problem I am having. 
Running on a p4 desktop with a firegl x1 gfx card. Lately it will hang alot more often, I used to get hangs when goofing around with that paint screen effect from compiz but now it happens for no reason.

I'm going to try turning off compiz(I have most of the "fancy" features on :P).
I'll also post my xorg logs in a little bit. 

Hmm this could be unrelated but, I had just fixed a problem with ubuntu failing to boot because of an incorrect configuration of grub after I rewrote the mbr on my windows drive. Well I fixed the problem by changing the boot partition values on my menu.lst file but after a hang just a few hours ago I restarted and realized the grub boot settings had reverted to their previous values. Is that normal O.o?

### Post by Shuri on 2008-02-19
Seemed to be alot more stable after turning off compiz, but now it keeps hanging while I try to install kde :(
Including my last 2 xorg logs. One note, on the last 2 hangs I could not even move the mouse anymore, so I could be having another problem now.

### Post by MHendryx on 2008-02-20
First, Thanks everyone for your ideas and similar problems.  I hope my solution works for you.

What finally worked for me -- and has worked now over a week -- is to go into System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Visual Effects, and click "None".  The result is to turn compiz off among other things (I think.)  Earlier in my trials and tribs I had read about a debate whether to issue 7.10 with or without the desktop effects.  The decision was in favor of adding the effects even though they were not as bug free as the rest of the OS.  I removed compiz through the Synaptic Package manager and thought that would be sufficient.  It did not occur to me to look at "preferences".  Thus every time I rebooted, the machine re-installed compiz.

On some other forum it might be worth while for the larger community to further debate the pros and cons of cutting edge "decorations" that are not rock solid.  (Obviously, I have tipped my hand.)

It was HDave and Cheecheo near the end of this link that clued me in; so all "Thanks" should go to them.  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/156289](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/156289)

I was just ready to post the same thing.  Removing the desktop effects has left me lockup free for a week now.

Sorry for late response, System->Preferences->Appearance->Visual Effects->None.

Feisty doesn't have that problem simply because it doesn't have Compiz.

If you want to keep Compiz on and don't want to experience this problem then you will need (in my case) ATI's (or probably NVIDIA's for others) proprietary drivers for your video/graphics card. Get envy ([http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html](http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html)) and install it and then envy will track down the driver, download it and install it for you.

It's not exactly too late to go back to Gutsy by the way. There is still one month and all you need to do is upgrade it to through the update manager (System->Administration->Update Manager->Upgrade) and all your files/settings will remain the same but you will have a new Ubuntu :D
