title: "Trying to set up home network"

### Post by jivabill on 2009-02-15
I had a network running here just fine.  The main computer was a windows 98se machine.  In other parts of the house I had a Compaq Desktop running Ubuntu 8.04 and a HP Laptop running Ubuntu 8.04.  The machines could all see each other and share the printer attached to the win98se machine.  Fine.

The way I got that to happen is I turned them all on and then installed ALL the samba packages that looked applicable from the repository on each Ubuntu machine.  Everything then worked.

Then my son in FL sent me a new to me Dell 4400 Desktop running XP Pro.  I thought, this is easy, I'll just move the Dell XP Pro machine in here and it will be my main computer.  The win98se machine will join the Ubuntu machines in other parts of my house.
WRONG.

I got the Dell built out to my liking and in place.  I set up all the folders to share and printer sharing and used the XP Network Wizard.  Then I could see all the shared folders on all the other computers from the Dell XP Pro machine.

Then I tried the win98se machine and it could see the shares on the Dell XP Pro machine and share the network printer.  Dandy.

BUT then I tried the Compaq Ubuntu machine.  It could see the shares on the Dell XP Pro machine but could not open them.  Got a message said it could not mount the share.

Tried to print to the network printer, a ONE LINE page took over 5 minutes to be printed.  Got a CIFS error message.

Same things happened with the Ubuntu HP Laptop.  

AND the Laptop and Compaq can not see each other on the network.

I have all the samba packages that look faintly necessary installed on both the Ubuntu machines.  That worked when the main computer (windows server) was the win98se machine.  It don't work under XP for the windows server.

I have read about 100 pages of "helpful" posts and tutorials, nothing helps.

Any ideas welcome.

Try temporarily turning off the Windows Firewall and/or any other firewall programs running on the Windows machine. Then check if network facilities are working. If they are, post back on specifics of Windows Firewall configuration.

Hi Prsha, nice to meet you.  I don't use Windows Firewall.  I am using ZoneAlarm Free version.  In the firewall configuration I have the network described as a trusted zone.  I have also added the IP Address of each of the client machines as trusted zones.  AND sometime back I tried turning off ZoneAlarm completely (shut down of ZA) and had the very same problems trying to see shares and print to the network printer.  Thanks for your input.

Please post more information about your network; dynamic / static IP? If dynamic (auto-config) IP, where is the DNS server? Can you ping each machine from all other machines? Can you access shares by using the IP address instead of the machine names? Can you also post your /etc/samba/samba.conf file?

If you have any doubts about the above:

a) for IP configuration, on the Windows machine's command prompt (Start-Programs-Command Prompt) give the command```
ipconfig  /all
``` and on the Ubuntu machine's command prompt (Applications-Accessories-Terminal), give the command```
ifconfig
```

b) To use ping open the terminal, and give the command```
#for Ubuntu
ping -c 4 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
#for Windows
ping xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

``` (Replace xxx's with your target machine IP address). If you get 80-100% replies (0-20% loss) then your network seems to be OK.

c) To connect to network resources manually on your Windows machines, open Nautilus (Places-Home) and in the address bar, give ```
smb://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/mountname
```; replace xxx's with Windows machine IP address, and "mountname" with a sharename on the Windows machine. Note that sharenames are case-sensitive (mydocs != MyDocs)

Please post back with the above requested information.

Hi PRsha

Sorry for the day of delay, I got stuck in some other work.  Just read your good post.

Thank you thank you for the good information.  I think that will help me to make progress.  Most of the command line majic is over my skill level at present so your post really fits my needs.  I will work on it and post back asap with results.

Thank you again

Hi Prsha

OK, it is late at night here so I have only part of what you asked so far.  The rest tomorrow.  First thing though, I did the IPConfig /all on the Windows XP (main computer) and got a whole page of stuff.  Some of it looks like sensitive data?  Should I post it here or should it go to you in an email?
thanks
bill

If you post it here, anybody else can also jump in and help; but if you feel it is sensitive, you can PM (Private Message) it to me by clicking on my username to the left of this message (prshah) and selecting "Send a private message to prshah".

### Post by jivabill on 2009-02-17
Hi Prsha, thanks for your input on that matter.  I realized after re reading your instructions that I just need to extract certain settings/information from the IPConfig output so the sensitive information is likely not an issue.

So it is now about 12 noon Pacific Standard Time here, I have some time and am setting out to gather the information you requested.  More shortly.

Regards
bill

For Prsha

OK, here is the /etc/samba/smb.conf file FROM MY LAPTOP

Please note: After reading the Ubuntu Documentation "What is Samba and when do you need it" I saw that samba only needed to be installed on servers.  Since the Win XP machine in my network is the "server" and the Laptop is one of the Clients I removed ALL samba packages and then per the instructions installed smbfs and smbclient.  So my smb.conf file is below as it exists on the Laptop:

#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) 
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentary and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#

# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors.

For Prsha

OK here is the /etc/samba/smb.conf file from my Compaq Desktop
The Laptop and the Compaq Desktop are the two Ubuntu Clients in my would be network.

Keep in mind that on the Laptop I don't have the samba meta package installed, only smbclient and smbfs.

On this one, the Compaq Desktop I have EVERY samba package that was a Ubuntu default or looked useful installed making the Compaq a server.  Which I understand now to be wrong.  Anyway, here is smb.conf file

FOR PRSHA

OK here are my answers to your questions up the thread:

Looked at the IPConfig of my main computer, the XP machine which is supposed to be the server 

In the section ETHERNET ADAPTER LOCAL AREA CONNECTION
I see Dhcp Enabled Yes
Autoconfiguration Enabled Yes
The IP Address remains always the same every time I look at the system.
The DNS Servers that are listed look like the ones for my ISP
SO I need some guidance about static/dynamic IP, what it looks like.

Regarding pings
All the machines in the network can ping each other, the results show no packet loss and elapsed time of zero

Connection to shares manually
The Compaq Machine (running Ubuntu) sees shares on both windows machines (XP Server and win98se) when I put the address into the location bar
(smb:// IP Address / mountname)  

BUT when I try to open the Network Icon on the desktop with the Compaq machine I get a message, says it is opening Network, then, after some time, says it can not be displayed.

The Laptop machine (running Ubuntu) sees shares manually on the XP Server and on the win 98 machine 

BUT
The Laptop will not open the Network Icon on the Desktop, same problem as with the Compaq machine.

Thank you for your help, let me know any other info you need.
Regards
bill
