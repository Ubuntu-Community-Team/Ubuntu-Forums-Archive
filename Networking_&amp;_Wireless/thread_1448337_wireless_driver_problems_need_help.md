### Post by Hogeyfur on 2010-04-06
Just installed Ubuntu and i cant get my wireless adapter to work and i have no idea what i'm doing when it comes to building the driver

This is the name of the driver that i have is 2009_0525_RT3070_Linux_STA_v2.1.1.0.
This came in the CD with my wireless adapter
Below is the README_STA_usb file thats in the above mentioned folder
any help with this will be greatly appreciated

[INDENT]1> $tar -xvzf DPB_RT2870_Linux_STA_x.x.x.x.tgz
    go to "./DPB_RT2870_Linux_STA_x.x.x.x" directory.
    
2> In Makefile
     set the "MODE = STA" in Makefile and chose the TARGET to Linux by set "TARGET = LINUX"
     define the linux kernel source include file path LINUX_SRC
     modify to meet your need.

3> In os/linux/config.mk 
    define the GCC and LD of the target machine
    define the compiler flags CFLAGS
    modify to meet your need.
    ** Build for being controlled by NetworkManager or wpa_supplicant wext functions
       Please set 'HAS_WPA_SUPPLICANT=y' and 'HAS_NATIVE_WPA_SUPPLICANT_SUPPORT=y'.
       => #>cd wpa_supplicant-x.x
       => #>./wpa_supplicant -Dwext -ira0 -c wpa_supplicant.conf -d
    ** Build for being controlled by WpaSupplicant with Ralink Driver
       Please set 'HAS_WPA_SUPPLICANT=y' and 'HAS_NATIVE_WPA_SUPPLICANT_SUPPORT=n'.
       => #>cd wpa_supplicant-0.5.7
       => #>./wpa_supplicant -Dralink -ira0 -c wpa_supplicant.conf -d

4> $make
    # compile driver source code
    # To fix "error: too few arguments to function ¡¥iwe_stream_add_event"
      => $patch -i os/linux/sta_ioctl.c.patch os/linux/sta_ioctl.c

5> $cp RT2870STA.dat  /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/RT2870STA.dat
    
6> load driver, go to "os/linux/" directory.
    #[kernel 2.4]
    #    $/sbin/insmod rt2870sta.o
    #    $/sbin/ifconfig ra0 inet YOUR_IP up
        
    #[kernel 2.6]
    #    $/sbin/insmod rt2870sta.ko
    #    $/sbin/ifconfig ra0 inet YOUR_IP up

    $/sbin/ifconfig ra0 down

Before we compile a driver from source, as fun as that would be, please help yourself and me with three simple terminal commands. Only two will have results; please post the results of the other two and we may be able to shortcut the process. Please open a terminal and do:```
sudo updatedb
locate rt2870sta.ko
lsusb
```Thanks.
