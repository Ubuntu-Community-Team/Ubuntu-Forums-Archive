Hello, 

I'm struggling with a slightly odd error message I am seeing when I try to print a document via Samba. 

The general configuration is that I have a desktop machine with a printer attached. This printer is shared via samba. 

On the same network (wirelessly) are two laptops. One of these can connect to the desktop printer without any problems, and prints fine. The other laptop can (apparently) see the printer, can select it from the list and see the details of the printer, but if you try and print to it you get the error message "Idle - Can't load /etc/samba/smb.conf - run testparm to debug it". (Screenshot below.) This is despite the two laptops apparently being configured identically on Samba.

Now, given that I can print fine from one laptop to the desktop, but not from the other laptop to the desktop, I am assuming that the problem is in the laptop. And also that the "Can't load smb.conf" error message is suggesting that the laptop can't see the smb.conf file on the desktop. is this correct? 

I should also add that the desktop also shares some shared drives, to both laptops, and these work fine. 

I've copied the smb.conf file from the desktop at the end of this message. 

All the machines are running Ubuntu 11.04. 

So, my question is how to resolve this issue, with one computer apparently not being able to see the smb.conf file on the printer server? 

All help welcomed - thank you. 


Oli.

#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors. 
# A well-established practice is to name the original file
# "smb.conf.master" and create the "real" config file with
# testparm -s smb.conf.master >smb.conf
# This minimizes the size of the really used smb.conf file
# which, according to the Samba Team, impacts performance
# However, use this with caution if your smb.conf file contains nested
# "include" statements. See Debian bug #483187 for a case
# where using a master file is not a good idea.

this is just a suggestion 
did you try CUPS  : 
on your borwser visit : [http://localhost:631](http://localhost:631)
then go to Admin tab
> 
CUPS is the standards-based, open source printing system developed by [Apple Inc.]("http://www.apple.com/") for Mac OS® X and other UNIX®-like operating systems.

I do not believe that the client is trying to view the smb.conf of the server. It's trying to read it's own. Smb.conf not only controls how a server acts but also a client.

Do what the error message suggests and run the following command on the client:
```
testparm -s
```Having said all that remember that Samba is being used as a pass-through to CUPS which has it's own server. Since it's Linux - to - Linux you can bypass samba altogether and connect directly to CUPS as suggested above.

Thank you for your answers Ibrahim and Morbius. Sorry not to have come back to this earlier. 

Ibrahim - I am using Samba. I didn't know that CUPS was an option, but given that I will (potentially) be printing from an XP lappie then I'm happy to carry on with Samba. Thanks for the browser link to the CUPS interface - I didn't know that existed. 

Morbius, thanks. I didn't know that smb.conf controlled the way that a machine connects as a Samba client - I thought it only controlled the way that a Samba server shared drives and printers. If this is the case then which parts of smb.conf on the client are relevant? 

Your test was useful - thank you. The results from putting in testparm -s are thus: 

1. On the machine that WON'T print remotely: 

```

ogp@X61s:~$ testparm -s
Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
rlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)
params.c:OpenConfFile() - Unable to open configuration file "/etc/samba/smb.conf":
	No such file or directory
Error loading services.
ogp@X61s:~$ 

```

2. On the machine that WILL print remotely: 

```

ogp@x31:~$ testparm -s
Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
rlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)
Processing section "[printers]"
Processing section "[print$]"

	browseable = No

[print$]
	comment = Printer Drivers
	path = /var/lib/samba/printers
ogp@x31:~$ 


``` 

It looks like this is the root of the problem; how do I go about solving it? 

Thanks again for your input. 


Oli.

**On x61s:**
```
sudo apt-get install samba-common
```If it says it's already there then reinstall it:
```
sudo apt-get --reinstall install samba-common
```**On x31:**
Try starting samba first:
```
sudo service smbd start
```If it tells you it's already started then restart it:
```
sudo service smbd restart
```Then run testparm again and see it it still gives you an error.
