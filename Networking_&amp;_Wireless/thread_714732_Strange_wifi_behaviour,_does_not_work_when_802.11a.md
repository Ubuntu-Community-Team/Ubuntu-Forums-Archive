Hello everyone,
I have a strange issue.
I have an almost freash gusty with every updates (gusty was a fresh install, not an upgrade)
My wlan works pretty well with every network I tried except in one specific place (and guess what, I have to work in that office).

I mean, my ipw3945 card works with excellent signal under winxp and does not find any ap in ubuntu. I think this could be because there is a 802.11a network at this place.
I also tried with a pccard netgear WG511T (chip atheros) and it behaves the same (works fine everywhere but at my working place).

Anyone has an idea ? Maybe I can force 802.11g.

sudo iwlist ath0 scan provides nothing or eventualy a blank essid (again, it works fine everywhere else)

I try to connect to a wep 64bits protected network.

Here is the result of lspci (with both wlan cards plugged in)
