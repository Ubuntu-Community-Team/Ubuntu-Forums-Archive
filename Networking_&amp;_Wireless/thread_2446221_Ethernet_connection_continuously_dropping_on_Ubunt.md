Hello! My internet connection is often very spotty and drops a lot especially during large downloads. The problem is intermittent and will go away for a little while after I restart the computer.

I ran lspci and got:

I ran sudo lshw -C network and got:

Any suggestions would be gratefully appreciated. Thanks!

You could try static IP. It would at least rule out DHCP problems.
