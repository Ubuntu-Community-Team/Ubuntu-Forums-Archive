Hi,

I have been on ubuntu for about 6 months now, and have never been able to get my wireless connection to work for my Acer Aspire 3050 laptop.

the outputs of lspci are (wifi card bolded)...

```

iwconfig shows me:
```
lo        no wireless extensions.

eth0      no wireless extensions.
```

Network admin does not list a wireless connection at all.

If my wifi card is being recognized, as it shows in the lspci listing, what do I need to do from there?

Thanks for any help you can give

Mike
