I installed Proftpd as per the unofficial Ubuntu starter guide, but when I try to run it I get:

ProFTPd warning: not started neithr in standalone nor in inetd/xinetd mode, apparently. Check your configuration.

Here is my config file:

#
# /etc/proftpd.conf -- This is a basic ProFTPD configuration file.
# To really apply changes reload proftpd after modifications.

I guess Proftpd doesn't like running from inetd. As standalone it seems to be working.
