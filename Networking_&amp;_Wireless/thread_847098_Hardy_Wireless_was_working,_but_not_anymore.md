'm running a Dell XPS 1530 with Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 4965 AG. I installed Ubuntu 8.04 a couple months back and it has been working flawlessly. I havn't used ubuntu in the past few weeks, and when I started it up today, the wireless isn't working. In Vista, wireless works fine. The switch is turned on, but I've noticed that the blue light "Wifi" above the keyboard isn't lit in Ubuntu, only in Vista. Now after searching the web for a solution for the past hour, I havn't really gotten anywhere. I used a wired connection to run the update manager, but that didn't change anything.


This is what outputs when I enter lspci in the terminal:

I entered iwconfig in the terminal and here's the output:

iwconfig
lo no wireless extensions.

eth0 no wireless extensions.

I guessed the driver was the issue here, so I downloaded the ndisgtk package and used it to install my Vista wifi driver, but to no avail. I still get "no wireless extensions".
