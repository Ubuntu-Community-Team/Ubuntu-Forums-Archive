I'm moving a customer from Vista to Ubuntu. I installed Lucid and everything seemed to work great. However when I tried the web cam (cheese, skype, gstreamer), my wireless connection went down. I repeated the process several times always with the same result.

The pc is Gateway T-Series model W350A.

Here is copy  of the  hardware report:

Any help will be greatly appreciated, since I would hate to have to go back to Vista.
