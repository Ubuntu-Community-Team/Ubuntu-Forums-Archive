Hello,

Tried to open an SSH server from a Windows machine (which is the server) to an Ubuntu machine (which is the client). If i connect to a local IP (ex. 10.0.0.1) the connection is successfully established and everything is fine. 
How ever, if i try connecting remotly the connection is terminated by the windows machine. The connection is made and port forwarding is configured. The `ssh -vvv root@externalip`'s output is:
```
root@localhost:/etc/ssh# ssh -vvv root@XXX.XXX.com
OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1, OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012

The content of the configuration file:

```
# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.  See
# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
# users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.

# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.

# Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
# list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
# ssh_config(5) man page.

Any idea about the solution?
