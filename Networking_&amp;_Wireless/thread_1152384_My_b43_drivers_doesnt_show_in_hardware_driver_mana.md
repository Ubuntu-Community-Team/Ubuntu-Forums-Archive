As the title says: I have downloaded and installed the b43 drivers +firmware. However, they do not show up in the hardware driver manager. The only drivers that show is the STA driver. My wireless works when I activate those, but I need the b43 drivers. 

I used the 8.10 version and I could simply not make this work, so finally yesterday I updated to the 9.04 version. Also here I got an error message when installing the b34 drivers. (I just used update manager for this)

After I updated to 9.04 neither of the drivers worked (STA or b43- I actually had to boot my old version 8.10 kernel 26.27.7 version to even get on-line)

So can anybody help me with this.. I have the drivers downloaded and installed but I can simply not activate them in hardware driver manager because they dont even show there.

I am fairly new to Ubuntu so go easy on me with the technical terms:D
Would be great if someone could help me figure this out as I have been struggling with this issue for quite some time now..
