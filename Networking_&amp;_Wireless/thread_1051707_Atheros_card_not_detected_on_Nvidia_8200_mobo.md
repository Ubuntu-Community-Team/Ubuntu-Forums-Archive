Hi everyone,
I just setup a new system on a Nvidia 8200 motherboard and install 8.10 on it. I previously had a 8.10 installation on my previous machine with the same Atheros wifi card that worked just fine. 

In my new install the card is not even detected in the hardware list. It is being detected I presume as C. P. Technologies. 

How can I get my wifi card working once again ?? 

Here is the output from my lspci command -
