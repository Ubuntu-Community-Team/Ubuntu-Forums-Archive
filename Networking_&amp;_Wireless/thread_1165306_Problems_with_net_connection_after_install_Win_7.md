Hi everyone

i use ubuntu for about 6 months (i'm still a junior here) and i never had problems with my net connection.
However, yesterday i installed Win 7 in dual boot with my ubuntu 8.04 and it did well. But then i realize that i have net connection on Win 7, but not on ubuntu 8.04. I dont have any idea about the relation of installing win 7 and get problems with net connection.

I start a live session with the 8.04 installation cd and i dont have net too. But then i tried the same think but with 9-04 session cd and i have net without problems.

here i'll put the content of /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and the ifconf result:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback



# Configuration file for /sbin/dhclient, which is included in Debian's
#	dhcp3-client package.
#
# This is a sample configuration file for dhclient. See dhclient.conf's
#	man page for more information about the syntax of this file
#	and a more comprehensive list of the parameters understood by
#	dhclient.
#
# Normally, if the DHCP server provides reasonable information and does
#	not leave anything out (like the domain name, for example), then
#	few changes must be made to this file, if any.
#

#send dhcp-client-identifier 1:0:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;
