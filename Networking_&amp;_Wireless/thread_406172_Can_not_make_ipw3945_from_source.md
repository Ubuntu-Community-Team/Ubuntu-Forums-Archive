I have a custom 2.6.20 kernel with ieee built in. However when I try to install ipw3945 i get the following error on make:
```

/bin/sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
/bin/sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
-e 
 WARNING: Your kernel contains ieee80211 symbol definitions and you
are not using the kernel's default ieee80211 subsystem.  (Perhaps you
used the out-of-tree ieee80211 subsystem's 'make install' or have
provided a path to the ieee80211 subsystem via IEEE80211_INC.)

If you wish to use the out-of-tree ieee80211 subsystem then it is
recommended to use that projects' "make patch_kernel" facility
and rebuild your kernel to update the Module symbol version information.

Failure to do this may result in build warnings and unexpected
behavior when running modules which rely on the ieee80211 subsystem.

 
-e  Aborting the build.  You can force the build to continue by adding:

        IEEE80211_IGNORE_DUPLICATE=y

to your make command line.


make: *** [check_inc] Error 1

```
Adding the ignore duplicate=y doesn't get me anywhere either:
```

dave@dave-laptop:~/wireless/ipw3945-1.2.0$ make IEEE80211_IGNORE_DUPLICATE=y
/bin/sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected

 ERROR: A compatible subsystem was not found in the following path[s]:

You need to install the ieee80211 subsystem from http://ieee80211.sf.net
and point this build to the location where you installed those sources, eg.:

        % make IEEE80211_INC=/usr/src/ieee80211/

or use the 'make patch_kernel' within the ieee80211 subsystem to patch your
kernel sources.

make: *** [check_inc] Error 1

```

Since I have a custom kernel I can't just install from the restricted modules right?
