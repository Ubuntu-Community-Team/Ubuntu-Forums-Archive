Hi, I'm very new to Ubuntu (and to this forum) and have just installed the operating system on a laptop.  I have a WPC11 v4 wireless adapter  and I'm trying to install ndiswrapper which I have as a zipped file on my jumpdrive.  My laptop doesn't have an internet connection so I've been download apps on another computer and putting them onto the drive.  How can I install ndiswrapper from the drive?  I'd appreciate any help.  I'm learning as I'm going along.:confused:

Your best bet is to compile the ndiswrapper source code on a machine with an internet connection and then tar it up and transfer it for installation on the target machine. Otherwise, you'll have to transfer all of the necessary packages over to the jump drive, as well. The necessary packages are build-essential and linux-headers-`uname -r`, but build-essential has dependencies and the dependencies have dependencies and so forth.

I've been looking on the ndiswrapper instructions from sourceforge.net as well as reading about the add remove programs/apt etc.  Is apt something that I have to download as well or is it on the Ubuntu 7.04 cd?  I have a CD that I ordered and an alternative CD that I downloaded from the net.  Sometimes the process seems pretty straightforward and sometimes not.  Can I use add/remove without having the application options sourcing the net?  If I have the ndiswrapper unzipped to a folder on the desktop can I install it from there.  Also whats the best way to compile the info on a windows machine to transfer to a jump drive to install on the ubuntu machine.  Thank you for you help and patience with my questions.:)

Apt is pre-installed and is present on the Live CD.

No. You need an internet connection to retrieve software using Apt.

What you could do is the following:
[LIST=1]
[*]Load up the Live CD on your Windows PC
[*]Download the linux-headers-`uname -r` and build-essential on that computer (will be stored in RAM)
[*]Download the newest ndiswrapper source code
[*]Compile the source code on that computer
[*]Copy the compiled code to a jump drive
[*]Copy the code to the Ubuntu computer and extract it
[*]Install ndiswrapper on the Ubuntu computer
[/LIST]
I imagine that's the easiest way to do it.

There IS an easier way.

insert your alternate install CD (its 7.04 as well, correct?)
run this command "sudo apt-cdrom add -d /dev/cdrom"

then go into synaptic and install "ndiswrapper"

Hi,  I tried the command line sudo apt-cdrom add -d /dev/cdrom and I got the error
E:  unable to start mount point  /dev/cdrom - stat (20 not a directory)
E: failed to mount the cd rom

Also, is there a book or web site that you'd recommend to read up on this.  Any ideas on how to deal with this error?

Thanks!

**[SIZE="4"]Download, Compiling, Installing and Configuring Ndiswrapper from Source Files[/SIZE]**

If you already have an internet connection (ie a working wired ethernet connection),
please skip to step #4. Without any internet connection, please begin at step #1.

All commands typed at command prompt:

```

   1. After booting into Ubuntu, put the Ubuntu installation CD in drive and wait for it to "spin up"
   2. sudo apt-cdrom add
   3. sudo aptitude update
   4. sudo aptitude install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`
```


OK next we want to download the ndiswrapper source files (Reference URL = _[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482)_)

We are grabbing ndiswrapper-1.48-rc1

***The following section will work if you have an internet connection
*** If you do not have an internet connection, on a different computer you will need to download the ndiswrapper source file from: 
[http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz](http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz)
Please place this file on a flash drive (USB Flash drive), transfer it to the Ubuntu machine, and then place it in the ~/ndiswrapper directory.  Continue with the next following set of instructions
```
cd ~
mkdir ndiswrapper
wget http://superb-east.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz -O ~/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz 
cd ndiswrapper

```

Extract, compile, and install ndiswrapper
```
tar -zxvf ndiswrapper-1.48rc1.tar.gz
cd ndiswrapper-1.48rc1
make distclean
make
sudo make install
```

Verify installation with
```
ndiswrapper -v
```

The output should be something like the following:
```

utils version: '1.9', utils version needed by module: '1.9'
module details:
filename:       /lib/modules/2.6.20-16-generic/misc/ndiswrapper.ko
version:        1.48rc1
vermagic:       2.6.20-16-generic SMP mod_unload 586

```

Next create and place your Window's wireless driver into ~/driver:
```
cd ~
mkdir driver
cd driver
```

Ensuring the ***.sys and ***.inf file for the Window's driver are in the~/driver directory:
```
sudo ndiswrapper -i *****.inf
```

Verify installation with:
```
ndiswrapper -l
```
Make sure no errors are reported and you get something like:
> 
bcmwl5: driver installed
device (14E4:4320) present


Ok, to insert the ndiswrapper module into the linux kernel:
```
sudo depmod -a
```

Ensure you dont get any errors when running this command.  Then:
```
sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
```

To verify there wasnt any errors:
```
dmesg
```
and look for something like:
> ndiswrapper version *version* loaded

Next lets make an alias for wlan0 associated with ndiswrapper
```
sudo ndiswrapper -m
```

And ensure that the ndiswrapper module is loaded at boot:
```
echo "ndiswrapper" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
```

I recommend rebooting at this time.
```
sudo shutdown -r now
```

Additional modifications may be needed to your /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/iftab files (see below).
In addition, please turn off any (WEP/WPA/MAC filtering) that may be present in the router.  This is to confirm that the basic ndiswrapper setup can connect to an unencrypted network.  Instructions how to configure for WEP/WPA encryption are included in another separate guide. 

Ndiswrapper by default assumes your card to be assigned to the interface wlan0 -- this may or may not be the case.

Below are some strategies that I have used to ensure that your wireless device is assigned to the wlan0 interface.

**Verification/Modification of /etc/iftab file**

The /etc/iftab file acts to permanently asssociate a given MAC Address with an interface name.  Additions in this file are only necessary if you need to lock down the interface name with a MAC Address.  First discover what interface name is currently associated to your network card MAC Address:
```
lshw -C network
```

Example output:
```

  *-network               
       description: Wireless interface
       product: BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller
       vendor: Broadcom Corporation
       physical id: 0
       bus info: pci@06:00.0
       **logical name: wlan0**
       version: 03
       **serial: 00:12:17:35:17:10 **
       width: 32 bits
       clock: 33MHz
       capabilities: bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless
       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ndiswrapper+lsbcmnds driverversion=1.48rc1+Cisco-Linksys ,LLC.,02/1 ip=192.168.1.101 latency=64 multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11g
       resources: iomemory:3c000000-3c001fff irq:11

```

In the example above my card's MAC Address - 00:12:17:35:17:10 - is currently assigned to wlan0 (logical name line).  If your card is assigned to a different logical name (such as eth1, ath0, ra0), then modifications will be needed to your /etc/iftab file.  

To modify your /etc/iftab file:
```
gksu gedit /etc/iftab
```

You will need to ensure your interface name is associated with wlan0 rather than a different interface name. There are two ways to accomplish this: 
#1) Let the computer do it automatically at boot, 
#2) Manually make the association  

In case #1 manually comment all the associations listed in your /etc/iftab file -- allow the computer to assign them internally at boot.  **This solution is probably the most viable for most users.**  An example of how to accomplish this:  

```

# This file assigns persistent names to network interfaces.
# See iftab(5) for syntax.

#eth1 mac 00:12:17:35:17:10 arp 1

```

Because the association of eth1 with the MAC Address was commented, the computer will internally and automatically make the assocation of an interface name with the MAC address.  This process of associating wlan0 with the networking device's MAC Address should work about 99% of the time.  If for some reasom it does not, proceed to step #2.

In case #2 - Manually make the association you need to ensure there is only one MAC address associated with one interface name.

```

# This file assigns persistent names to network interfaces.
# See iftab(5) for syntax.

#eth1 mac 00:12:17:35:17:10 arp 1
wlan0 mac 00:12:17:35:17:10 arp 1

```

In this example the old interface associated of eth1 was commented, and the new association of wlan0 to the card MAC address was made manually.

If modification of the /etc/iftab file was performed, a reboot is recommended at this time.
```
sudo shutdown -r now
```

**Modification of /etc/network/interfaces file**

First step is to comment out all the unnecessary interface names with the file.  In order to discover what interface names are currently needed:

```
lshw -C network
```
With all the devices listed, note their logical names.  An example:

```

  *-network               
       description: Wireless interface
       product: BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller
       vendor: Broadcom Corporation
       physical id: 0
       bus info: pci@06:00.0
       **logical name: wlan0**
       version: 03
       serial: 00:12:17:35:17:10
       width: 32 bits
       clock: 33MHz
       capabilities: bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless
       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ndiswrapper+lsbcmnds driverversion=1.48rc1+Cisco-Linksys ,LLC.,02/1 ip=192.168.1.101 latency=64 multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11g
       resources: iomemory:3c000000-3c001fff irq:11

```

Only the names mentioned with this command need to be listed in the /etc/network/interfaces file (along with the loopback address).

First backup your current interface file configuration in case something goes wrong:
```
sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.bak

To modify your /etc/network/interfaces file:
[CODE]gksu gedit /etc/network/interfaces
```


A basic interface file, might include the following (assuming a wired ethernet device is present - eth0, and the wireless device installed with ndiswrapper - wlan0) -- Note in this example I commented out the old eth1 interface -- I could have also removed these lines to have the same effect.

```

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp

#auto eth1
#iface eth1 inet dhcp

```

Further modications may be needed to this file, depending if you need to run your card in roaming mode (convenient with laptops that often connect to different routers of networks), configure your card with static IP address, desire to set WEP/WPA authentication parameters manually, etc.  Again there are many possibilites at this point, far too many to list the different permutations, however this gives you a basic starting point.
