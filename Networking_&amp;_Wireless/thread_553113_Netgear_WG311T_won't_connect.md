I recently picked up a Netgear WG311T PCI with an Atheros chipset for obvious reasons. However, when I attempt to use it normally to connect to my router, it always fails. I saw a few similar posts on the forum for this but they're for Dapper or Edgy, I'm running Feisty. I tried wlassistant and the networking tools Ubuntu comes with but have had no luck.
