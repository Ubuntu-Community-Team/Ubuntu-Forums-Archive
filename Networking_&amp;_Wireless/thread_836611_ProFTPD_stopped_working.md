Hi everyone, 

I have had a proftpd server up and running for a couple months and it has suddenly ceased to start, giving the error: 

sudo: unable to resolve host kagura
 * Starting ftp server proftpd                                                   
 - warning: unable to determine IP address of 'kagura'
 - error: no valid servers configured
 - Fatal: error processing configuration file '/etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf'
                                                                         [fail]

I haven't changed my config file since setting this server up.  Here it is in it's entirity:

I found another post on the ubuntuforums discussing this, but there was no resolution.  It was recommended that the user look at their hosts and hostname file also, so here those are:

127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 kagura.HOME

hosts file:

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts

hostname file:

kagura

Any help you can provide in getting this server back up and running is greatly appreciated!

This has got to be the quickest fix I've ever managed by myself.  I editing my hosts file to : 

127.0.0.1 localhost
**127.0.1.1 kagura**

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts

And the server starts fine now.  The '.HOME' bit was created I think when I set this box up to run on a SAMBA network I have in place.  The SAMBA network connection is still working fine, so this fix doesn't appear to have broken anything else in the procss of fixing the PROFTDP service.  

Yay!
