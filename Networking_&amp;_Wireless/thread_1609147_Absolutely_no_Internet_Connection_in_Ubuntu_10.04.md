Hi everyone,

My last laptop's screen died and so I bought a new Compaq Presario CQ62. I immediately swapped in the old Hard Drive, however, upon doing that, I was unable to connect to any networks, either wired or wirelessly. So I decided to try installing Ubuntu 10.04 over top of the old Ubuntu installation (my /home directory is on a separate partition). However, that has still failed to work, as I am unable to connect to a network in any way, shape, or form.
