Hi everyone.

I've looked through the threads on here and found this to be a somewhat common problem and I have tried everything that I could find to fix it, to no avail.

I have a Toshiba Satellite A200. when I run the commands to see your cards, nothing comes up. Here are some of the results of the common commands that are asked to see in previous posts:

laptop:~$ lsusb
Bus 005 Device 003: ID 04f2:b008 Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd 
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0483:2016 SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint Reader
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  

```

laptop:~$ iwconfig
lo        no wireless extensions.

eth0      no wireless extensions.

```

I tried sudo lshw -C -network as well but nothing came up.

I have had this wireless card working in Ubuntu before (though I believe it was 6.06). Now it doesn't even appear to recognize it. Please help!
Thanks
