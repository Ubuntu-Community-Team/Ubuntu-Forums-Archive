I want to remote control my ubuntu server edition.

How do I grant complete total acces to a user to the files on the server via ftp? I've tried many things but they doesnt work.

If its possible through webmin please tell me, because webmin works.

Thanks

did I get you right? by uncommenting **local_enable=yes** in ***/etc/vsftpd.conf*** you can allow a user to access the home folder and upwards.

1st of all don't use ftp, its old and insecure. Use ssh (Secure SHell)

You will probably need to install ssh-server on the box you want to remote control
sudo apt-get install ssh-server

Then from your local machine type
ssh yourname@yourpc

for full access. You may want to use
ssh -X -Y yourname@yourpc (Capital X and Y)

This will enable X11 forwarding and let you run KDE/gnome applications remotely

If you want to copy files, use sftp yourname@yourpc - just like ftp but secure

if i connect via sftp in jedit i cant get in. I can see the list of files, but I cant save. It says permission denied. The same goes if I try normal FTP in Jedit.

Its proftpd, its that the same setting as vsftp?

Heres my config:
```

# /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf -- This is a basic ProFTPD configuration file.
