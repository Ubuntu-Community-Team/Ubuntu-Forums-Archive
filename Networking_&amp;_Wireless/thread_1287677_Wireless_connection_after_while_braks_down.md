Hi.

My wireless connection break down (the NetworkManager is showing that i am connected, but no responses are from the network by trying to get ping) after while and only one helps when i restart my **NetworkManager** with the command:

```
sudo invoke-rc.d NetworkManager restart
```

but after while happens the same.

also NetworkManager won't detect networks when i start my PC (DELL D630, Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 4965 AG or AGN) without enabled wifi switch. When i enable it after start PC nothing happend.

same command helps to get list of available networks:

```
sudo invoke-rc.d NetworkManager restart
```

WRITE ME PLEASE WHAT I CAN DO TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. (i now i need to get any log to detect the issue, or install wicd like a replacement of NetworkManager, but i like NetworkManager so please if you now what is is the source of this issue....
