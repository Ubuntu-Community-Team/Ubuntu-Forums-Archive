Hello

I've installed 10.04, and now my wifi won't connect anymore. It will do fine on any other channels except 14. 8.04 and 6.06 were capable of accessing channel 14 out the the box. Running 

```
iwlist channel
```

gives

where we can see that channel 14 is missing. Does anyone know which file we have to edit in order to get channel 14 back?

Current card is an Intel 5300 AGN if that makes any difference.

Thanks
