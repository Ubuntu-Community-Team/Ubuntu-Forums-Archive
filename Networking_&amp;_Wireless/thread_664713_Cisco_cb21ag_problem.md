I have a few Cisco cb21AG wireless cards, they use the ar52XX chipset(whichever one is a/b/g). One I have will not be recognized by the kernel. The relevent dmesg output is:

[ 4388.809003] pccard: CardBus card inserted into slot 0
[ 4388.809033] PCI: device 0000:07:00.0 has unknown header type 07, ignoring.

I was wondering if there was a way to make this card behave properly, such as a way to reflash it so that the header is of a recognized type.


I will post the dmesg output of a working card in a few minutes as an edit, since I don't have one in hand right now.

Also here is my lspci output:

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
