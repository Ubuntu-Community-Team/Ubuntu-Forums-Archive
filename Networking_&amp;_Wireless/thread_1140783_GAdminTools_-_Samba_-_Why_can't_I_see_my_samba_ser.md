### Post by Roasted on 2009-04-27
I previously had system-config-samba (in the repos) installed. It did what I needed but it was very, very basic.

I was just suggested GAdmin Tools with Samba. I downloaded it and it's a very feature-filled GUI. I'm trying to get used to it and I'm testing it on a spare computer I have here.

With an iBook G4, along with an XP Pro laptop, I was previously able to connect to my Samba server, which is named Area51. With the XP Pro laptop I could start - run - \\Area51 and I'd see the shares. Now, the XP Pro laptop doesn't see it.

I've rebooted the desktop (Samba Server, Area51) along with the laptop running XP. Nothing worked yet.

Here's my smb.conf:

```
