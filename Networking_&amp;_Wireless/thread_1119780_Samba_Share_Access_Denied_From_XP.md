title: "Samba Share Access Denied From XP"

### Post by UltraSmooth on 2009-04-08
I have a samba shared folder that is not accessible from Windows XP using the hostname. The server and share are visible using \\SERVER_NAME but when I double click on the folder and am prompted to login I get the message "<Share> is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource..." If i access the share via \\192.168.0.9\Share I have no problems accessing and writing to the folder. I reproduced this on a couple of XP machines. On the other hand, i have a couple of Win2K machines and they have no issues connecting either by hostname or IP, so it must be XP specific.

I am running Ubuntu Server 8.10.

Anyone have any ideas what would cause this behaviour? Here is my smb.conf file:

```


#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) 
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentary and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors.

I seem to have the same problem with the latest version of Ubuntu 10.10

Me too.  

I've come closest to success with the ordinary Nautilus-based sharing:  I can see the Ubuntu share, but can't open it.  From the Ubuntu machine in question, I can open the share and navigate the folders on it which I have given share permission.

I like the degree of control offered in the system-config-samba tool (it installs as the menu item System-->Administration-->Samba), but I can't seem to get the settings right; taking my best shot at it a couple of different ways resulted both times in no longer seeing my Ubuntu share from the XP computer until I started over with a fresh samba.conf file in /etc/samba.  

I do note that the Nautilus-based sharing is configured in /var/lib/samba/usershares with files which bear the names of shared folders.  Is there some parameter I can add or set in there, perhaps the "acl" ("access control list"?), to enable XP to browse the share?  I've set the "guest_ok" to "y" but to no avail.

I've come closest to success with the ordinary Nautilus-based sharing:  From the XP machine, I can see the Ubuntu share, but if I try to open it, Windows says it's "not accessible" and that I "might not have permission to use this network resource"; if I try to view the Ubuntu share's properties, Windows says the share "does not accept remote requests."  From the Ubuntu machine in question, however, I can open the share and navigate the shared folders within; and I can access the properties of both the share and the folders within, but interestingly, if I view the Permissions property, I get "The permissions of [the item in question] could not be determined."

I'm also having the same problem, but not using XP, i seem to be having it with Windows 7.

i'm also having the same problem with XP. i'm using Ubuntu 10.04.

i'd rather use the server name, because that is on the LAN within my office building instead of the through the internet with the IP Address.

i can access the server with ease when i add a network address like this:

 \\ip address\share 

but cannot for the life of me access it this way either

\\server\share.

i too, can see the server on the workgroup on our local network, but just can't access it. won't allow to do so.

### Post by raydar on 2011-01-20
Hey, cormu7, thanks for the tip--I tried the IP address method, and it worked like a charm!

I'm tempted to wonder what gives with the difference, but for the moment I'm just elated that it worked!

@ cormu7 and @raydar,

I would check to see if the **nmbd **daemon is running.  The **nmbd ** provides naming services.  you can do this from the command line like this:```
ps -ef | grep mbd
```

I would think you should have 2 instances of **smbd **and 1 of **nmbd**

Here is what I get:```
$ps -ef | grep mbd
root      4324     1  0 21:05 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/nmbd -D
root      4326     1  0 21:05 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/smbd -D
root      4350  4326  0 21:05 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/smbd -D
bruce     4469  4388  0 21:06 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto mbd

```

### Post by cormu7 on 2011-01-21
redmk2, that could have been it.

that seemed to do the trick I just typed 

```
 sudo restart smbd
 sudo restart nmbd 
```

And now i am able to access the local network, and add a network place with \\server\share with no problems.

Thanks for the suggestion.

EDIT: this is not appropo since the op can connect by IP, so disregard, but may be useful info for other troubleshooters so I will leave as is. 

ok, i notice you have your smb.conf set for "security = user"
thats great as i recommend it as well, but it means that you may need to register all remote users with both your kernel and with samba.

so, what username are you using to connect from the XP machine? do you have a user with the same name on the fileserver? 

to register an existing ubuntu user with samba, use this command
```
sudo smbpasswd -a <username>
``` and put in your password when prompted. if the user does not exist yet as an ubuntu user, create it under 
System -> Administration -> Users and Groups.

the other thing to consider is your file system permissions on the folder. 

post back these from the server:

```

sudo testparm -s
net usershare info
ls -al <path to a share>

```and if you smb.conf has changed, post back your alterations.

Did you notice that the OP was almost 2 years ago.  Maybe the OP is still interested, but my guess is that the they have solved their issues.  This is the problem with allowing threads to live forever.  Folks attach their issues to old threads rather than starting new ones.

There are plenty of threads with this issue.  Samba has changed, Ubuntu has changed since 2009.

nope, that i did not. when a thread shows up in the "New Posts" search, it has the presumption of being timely. you're right, necromancy it is.

I also cannot connect to the shares of my Ubuntu 11.10 when I use the netbios name via Windows 7. When I use the IP adress it works like a charm though. Interesting: If I allow everybody to the share, then it also works with the netbios name...
However, a restart of nmbd did not do the job. Is there any working solution to the problem?

Cheers Martur

Don't you think this is the same problem?

In Ubuntu 11.10 I discovered similar issues to the lack of access by hostname and also by IP address.  Even though I had set up the share correctly and allowed a specific user the rights to access it.  It could not be viewed.  Even after smbd and nmbd restarts.  Sometimes it's the fundamentals like the directory ownership being incorrect.  Make sure the owner and group of the directory for the share are set to contain the smbuser and the directory permissions match accordingly.

Here is a very simple smb.conf file that works for sharing files. This is from my server that just hosts files and does not act as a domain controller.

When adding a user for samba you must

sudo adduser USERNAME

sudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME


First adds user to Unix passwd file, the second adds the user to samba so they can access the shares


The share 'sys' on there, is the one you should modify to make your own share

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Samba version 3.4.7

Remember to set permissions on the folders you create in your shares


If you make the username and password in the ubuntu system the same as the one on the windows machine, you wont be prompted for a username and password to access the shares allocated to that person. In samba the domain name does not matter unless you are using LDAP. In this case we are simply using the unix and samba password system

** First, the last few posts are making this far too complicated for the average user. 

Believe it or not Samba installs so that it works out of the box without the need for WINS servers or any type of overt LAN side DNS resolution gobbledygook. It does however assume certain rules to be followed ( hostnames have to be 15 characters or less in length ), things can get it the way ( firewalls mis-configured ), and sometimes it needs help ( put bcast first in "name resolve order" instead of last ).

Any deviation from the default smb.conf , unless required to fix a specific issue, will just lead to a mess.

** Second, as **redmk2** noted at the end of the Cold War above this thread is 2+ years old. The original poster has either resolved his problem or replaced all his machines with MacBooks - which as far as I can tell uses pixie dust to communicate with others of it's kind.

In your smb.conf using 'sudo gedit'add:
force user = YOUR NAME HERE

I usually just place it under the work group entry.

### Post by walterbyrd on 2012-02-08
I am having the same problem. Lunbuntu 11.10, and Windows 7, both 64-bit. Nothing I have seen here has been helpful to me. I created user accounts and all that. 

I am just using this at home, security is not a real issue.

Here is my smb.conf file:

```
#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors. 
# A well-established practice is to name the original file
# "smb.conf.master" and create the "real" config file with
# testparm -s smb.conf.master >smb.conf
# This minimizes the size of the really used smb.conf file
# which, according to the Samba Team, impacts performance
# However, use this with caution if your smb.conf file contains nested
# "include" statements. See Debian bug #483187 for a case
# where using a master file is not a good idea.
#

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = WORKGROUP

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
#   wins support = no

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
   dns proxy = no

# What naming service and in what order should we use to resolve host names
# to IP addresses
;   name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast

#### Networking ####

# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
;   bind interfaces only = yes



#### Debugging/Accounting ####

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

# Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).
   max log size = 1000

# If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
# parameter to 'yes'.
#   syslog only = no

# We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
# should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log
# through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
   syslog = 0

# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d


####### Authentication #######

# "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
# in this server for every user accessing the server. See

# in the samba-doc package for details.
#   security = user

# 'encrypt passwords' in the smb.conf(5) manpage before enabling.
   encrypt passwords = true

# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.  
   passdb backend = tdbsam

   obey pam restrictions = yes

# This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.
   unix password sync = yes

# For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
# parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan <<kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> for
# sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

# This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
# when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
# 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.
   pam password change = yes

# This option controls how unsuccessful authentication attempts are mapped
# to anonymous connections
   map to guest = bad user

Change this:

   valid users = walter

**[COLOR=Blue]   public = no[/COLOR]**
   writable = yes** The [homes] share is a special share type and has no path. Instead it creates a share of the users corresponding home directory when asked for by that user on the samba client. It is also not browsable - kind of defeats the purpose of a [homes] share - No one else is supposed to know that share exists.

** If you really want to share your home directory and actually make it publicly accessible then create a share of it explicitly.

** And if this recommendation does not help you please start your own thread.
