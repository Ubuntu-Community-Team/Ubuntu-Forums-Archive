Hey everyone. Here is my problem: 

I recently contracted a virus onto my HP dv2-1027 ca Notebook (using Windows Vista) In order to try and fix it, my friend reinstalled Windows XP.
[U]
However[/U] this totally messed with some of my drivers- the biggest difficulty being that the button that formerly signaled wireless internet now turns my computer off. I also could not connect to the internet using my ethernet cable.

After switching over to Ubuntu I can connect to the internet via the ethernet cable, but I still can not for the life of me fix my wireless. 

Looking at other threads I received the following information from Terminal:

I have no prior experience with Linux, nor do I really know where to access my BIOS. Any help would be so appreciated!
