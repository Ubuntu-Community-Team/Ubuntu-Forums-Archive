title: "Screen Resolution Xorg GUI not showing Mon options"

### Post by Krack1925 on 2009-03-30
Hello all,
I have searched and searched and can not find a thread that tackles my exact situation.  I know it is something simple and I am just missing it.

I have done several things at once so I will list them here first then tell you the problem.  I am going to try to be as specific as possible.

Built cheap piece of junk computer and had it attached to one monitor with the intent of adding it to better monitor through a KVM later.  That day has arrived and now it is defaulting to the lowest graphics settings.  So i become a xserver-xorg guy trying to figure this out.  when I run xrandr...  I only get two options.  So from reading threads that means I have to add it to the xorg... right?  So when I run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg i get a GUI interface that talks to me A LOT about my keyboard but nothing about the monitor.  Now the KVM was my first suspect but it is running XP great so I can not figure out how it would be good with windows and not Linux...  Next was the PCI graphics card...  do I have the right drivers.  So I look around and find the command lspci...  I have a Nvivia NV6 so them I look around some more and find sudo apt-get install nvidia settings.....  It seems to load some packets up but still no joy.  So...  now when I do a restart of the computer it tells me that my (EE) is unreadable (whatever the hell that means) and that it needs to start in low graphics mode...(which is all it would do anyway up till this point) 

So i know i need to edit either the xorg file or the nvidia drivers... but the GUI for each are either not bringing up video option or tells me I am not using the nvidia server.... 

Anybody got anything on this????
Thanks,
Kelly

I can't speak to your NVidia driver problem, but the way that the maximum resolution is determined is through EDID. This is a means for your monitor to tell the OS what refresh rates it can handle without damage. This information has to be passed from the monitor to the graphics card, and through the graphics card driver to X for this method to work. If X doesn't receive this information, it defaults to low values that won't damage any monitors, but only gives the option of low resolutions.

Most KVMs are really cheap, and don't pass on EDID information at all.

You can, however, tell X directly what refresh rates you'd like to use with your monitor. You'll need to find the specifications for your monitor, since setting these values incorrectly can damage your monitor. Then you'll need to add these refresh rate ranges (**HorizSync** & **VertRefresh**) to the "Monitor" section of your xorg.conf. Restarting X after making these changes should let X select higher resolutions.

Thanks for the response...  I have tried to set it manually but when I go into xorg...  It lets me fiddle around with the key board but nothing else.  The Kernal framebuffer device (????) is the first thing it asks me.  I can choose yes or no... I have went through the whole thing both ways and it is exactly the same.  I get 6 to 10 questions about my keyboard and nothing else.  I am pretty sure this is the issue but I just do know what to do to fix it.
I saw the stuff about the xorg on other threads but people seem to be seeing something I am not...
Tell me how to take a screen shot from terminal and past it here and I will do it....

You don't need to reconfigure the xorg package (which is what you appear to be doing). You can just edit X's configuration with ```
sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
``` You'll probably want to make a backup first, in case it all goes pear-shaped: ```
sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
``` You can easily copy this file back using the command line if you make it so that that's all you've got.

Ok...  it says 
Section "monitor"
Identifer "configured monitor"

I have been to this screen before but I just don't know what to put there...  Do I just plug in the screen res I want???

No.  **man xorg.conf** has lots of information about what you can put in there, and there are any number of examples of xorg.conf configurations posted on this forum. For that matter, there are quite a number of posts detailing this exact method to correct this exact problem.

Here is mine. Don't forget that your monitor is vanishingly unlikely to be the same as mine, so whatever you do, don't just blindly copy-and-paste mine into yours. This is just so that you can see the format of the options.

```
Section "Monitor"
        Identifier      "Eizo F77"
        Option          "DPMS"
        HorizSync       30-95
        VertRefresh     50-160
        DisplaySize     402 300
        Gamma           1.15
EndSection

```See where it says HorizSync & VertRefresh? Those are the lines that you'll be adding, with values for **your** monitor. Screen modes can be specified elsewhere in your xorg.conf, but armed with the information you've just provided, X should be able to automagically calculate the available screen modes without any other intervention on your part.

EDIT:
> Tell me how to take a screen shot from terminal and past it here and I will do it....

No need to take a screenshot. You can redirect output from the command line with **>**, such as
cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf > ~/Desktop/xorg.txt
which would read the contents of your xorg.conf and spit them into a file on your Desktop called xorg.txt. Just something that you might be interested in.

Well....  I did a few sec of research and got the the refresh rates...  I renamed it "dell 19in"  and added those two lines.  I did not know the rest.  Tried a restart...  Same ole Same ole...  So i went and looked again and below I added dell 19in to the section below and the saved.  Now.  It is still stopping me on the restart to tell me that my graphics are to low and the the framebuffer is wrong...  So...

#1 Did i do the other thing right??
#2 any idea what i might have done while trying to fix this that is now making it do that???  I have to leave in a little bit but I will work on this as soon as I get back....  thanks for all your help so far....

You only needed to add those two lines in. The Identifier in the Monitor Section has to match the Monitor that's defined in the Screen Section, which ties together a particular Monitor and Device to define a Screen. The ServerLayout section defines which Screens get used, and their alignments. So it doesn't really matter what you identify the monitor as, as long as it is **exactly** the same in both places.

In this context, the "framebuffer device" means your video card. I don't really have any idea what you mean by > It is still stopping me on the restart to tell me that my graphics are to low You could try posting your xorg.conf to see if anything jumps out to anyone as being obviously wrong, and give some more description of the symptoms you experience.

I don't think that any other drivers will help you. The TNT2 is too old for NVidia to support with their proprietary driver. The Free nv driver should work OK though. You'll probably want to uninstall any NVidia stuff that you've installed, since they use their own X implementation that tends to... complicate matters.

OK...  went through and deleted all the automatic backups that have been created every time I try to edit the xserver-xorg...
I re-entered the monitor info...  Did a hard restart and this came up about halfway though the boot process

Ubuntu is running in low graphics mode.
(EE) unable to find a valid framebuffer device
(EE) NV(0) Failed to open framebuffer devices, consult warnings
(EE) Screens found but none have usable configuration.

I was not getting this BEFORE i started all of this.  So... I am sure I did something... just not sure what.

As far as posting whatever.... i will post anything you want...  If i can figure it out...

The earliest of those would have been the configuration that you had before you started fiddling, but never mind.

If you put the contents of the file that you just created on your Desktop in a post here between [CODE] tags, it will be nice and easy to read.

/var/log/Xorg.0.log is X's log. That might be more verbose about where the problem lies.

Ok... you asked for it....  i am pretty sure that this will reveal me o be a complete idiot.  I am not even sure that i can post 1600 lines here but it is everything...

[LEFT]OK, that's weird;

[/LEFT]
```

(==) Using config file: "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.failsafe"

```Also, you've still got this, which I'd imagine is because it's not picking up your xorg.conf for some reason;

```

(II) VESA(0): Configured Monitor: Using hsync range of 31.50-37.90 kHz
(II) VESA(0): Configured Monitor: Using vrefresh range of 50.00-70.00 Hz

```This is all using the vesa driver from the failsafe configuration. I'd imagine that, since you've got the NV(0) error earlier in the boot sequence, that your xorg.conf that uses the nv driver fails, and so it loads xorg.conf.failsafe instead. The first part of the configuration process is certain to be logged as well, but I don't know offhand exactly where it would be. /var/log/Xorg.1.log, possibly. If you fancy trawling through your logfiles to find the one with the NV(0) errors in, you might find something enlightening. There's probably some devastatingly simple command-line way (using grep, possibly) to automatically generate a list of files that have that string in, but I wouldn't know what it was.

The simplest thing is probably to just post your current xorg.conf so that we can inspect the damage.

EDIT: Oh, and you don't need to do a hard reset to restart X. Ctrl-Alt-Backspace will suffice.

EDIT 2: typo

Is this what you are wanting???  If not.... how do I know which is the current xorg log file???

```
# xorg.conf (X.Org X Window System server configuration file)
#
# This file was generated by dexconf, the Debian X Configuration tool, using
# values from the debconf database.
#
# Edit this file with caution, and see the xorg.conf manual page.
# (Type "man xorg.conf" at the shell prompt.)
#
# This file is automatically updated on xserver-xorg package upgrades *only*
# if it has not been modified since the last upgrade of the xserver-xorg
# package.
#
# Note that some configuration settings that could be done previously
# in this file, now are automatically configured by the server and settings
# here are ignored.
#
# If you have edited this file but would like it to be automatically updated
# again, run the following command:
#   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Configured Video Device"
	Option		"UseFBDev"		"true"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"

	VertRefresh	56-76

EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Default Screen"
	Monitor		"dell monitor"
	Device		"Configured Video Device"
EndSection
```

Is that it? Man, the automatic configurations are lightweight. My xorg.conf was carefully hand-tuned before X got all of this hot-plug automatic configuration stuff, and so is a sprawling mess that specifies everything; keyboard, mouse, fonts, all sorts.

Oh yeah, I'd been typing "log" so much that my hands were just on automatic. I had meant to type xorg.conf. Sorry.

Anyway... you can probably comment out (put a # at the start of the line) the UseFBDev line, since it doesn't seem to be helping you much at the moment.

And it's possible that the automatic configuration voodoo that I don't really understand only works if the parts of the X Server configuration are named with the right magic names (and you sacrifice a black lamb under a full moon...) so it's probably worth changing the Monitor Identifier back to "Configured Monitor" in the Monitor and Screen sections.

It's also possible that you'll need to specify 
```
        Driver          "nv"
``` in the Device section, but it might not be. Try the other things first, and if they don't help try with that line in.

Fingers crossed.

ok... did all that and hard restart...  got difrent error message.
(EE) Problem parsing the config file
(EE) Error parsing the config file....
When it gave me the option to try to fix it.... I though sure why not???
Then I restarted and got the old messages....  I am probably done for the night...  So i will start fresh tomorrow and see if I can not figure it out then...
Thanks for all your help...
