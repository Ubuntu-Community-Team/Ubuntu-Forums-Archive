I have been trying to install octave, gnuplot, and grace.  They are listed as available packages for gutsy on the ubuntu website but they don't appear in either my add/remove programs list or in Synaptic Package Manager.  When I do

[PHP]sudo apt-get install octave[/PHP]

or for any of the other files it returns  

[PHP]Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Couldn't find package octave[/PHP]

I have included my sources.list below for reference.  Thanks in advance.

Your sources.list is all messed up.  You are missing the main, universe, and multiverse repos.  I would just go to[ this site]("http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic/") to generate a new list.
