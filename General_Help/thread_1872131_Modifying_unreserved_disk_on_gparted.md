hi.

it won't let me do anything.
I created new 30GB disk by Windows 7 tool, and it is unreserved.
I has to be NTFTS (or something like that) so i can install linux to it.
Am i using the wrong program? When i install Linux it won't let me do anything with the unreserved disk, and same with Gparted.
I can't make the disk dynamic, Linux simply doesn't work on dynamic disk and Windows 7 can only create dynamic disks.

I burned Gparted into a DVD-RW.

I am using windows 7 and i have 64-bit

if you know how to help me, then thanks.

You have to undo the dynamic disks. Use Windows tools for Windows and Linux tools for Linux. 
But even Windows will not do some repairs on dynamic disks.

First make sure you have backed up all you data. Make a system recovery set of DVDs and make a Windows repair CD.

Backups ---------
The vendor recovery DVDs are just an image of your drive as purchased. If you have housecleaned a lot of cruft normally included, run many updates with many reboots, and added software you may want a full back up.

Make your own Windows recoveryCD/repair:

Most seem to have had success with Minitool, but Microsofts offical policy is to backup can erase drive. Then recreate new basic partitions.

Dynamic volume is a Microsoft proprietary format developed together with Veritas (now acquired by Symantec) for logical volumes.
You can use a third-party tool, such as Partition Wizard 4.2. to convert a convert a dynamic disk to a basic disk without having to delete or format them.
The Partition Wizard software for Windows is supposed to be able to convert dynamic disks to regular partitions without data loss, so it may be what you need to get around this problem; however, I've never used it and so I can't be sure it will work.

Several users have used this, it has a liveCD download to use:
MiniTool Partition Wizard Professional Edition 5.2 to convert without loss of data the disk from dynamic disk to a basic disk.
also used Partition Wizard to set an existing partition logical instead of primary
