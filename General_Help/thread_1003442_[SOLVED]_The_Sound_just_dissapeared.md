> No volume control elements and/or devices found...

And I get this when I when I type in lspci:

Fixed thanks to the [Comprehensive Sound Problem Solutions Guide v0.5e]("http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449") 

> Getting the ALSA drivers from a *fresh* kernel

Sometimes, sound might be configured correctly, but for some reason or another (tinkering) it stops working. One way to go back to the old setup is to reinstall Ubuntu. However, this step is actually quite unnecessary since you are reinstalling everything because of one thing.

A faster way, is to just remove the problematic packages and reinstall them cleanly. 

(1) Remove these packages
```
sudo apt-get --purge remove linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils
```

(2) Reinstall those same packages
```
sudo apt-get install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils
```

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: Ubuntu (GNOME) users have reported that packages 'gdm' and 'ubuntu-desktop' are removed after removing the linux-sound-base packages. If this happens, then do the following
```
sudo apt-get install gdm ubuntu-desktop
```
