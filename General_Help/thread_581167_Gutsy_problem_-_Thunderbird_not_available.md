title: "Gutsy problem - Thunderbird not available"

### Post by rlelina on 2007-10-19
I did a new install of Gutsy and Thunderbird is nowhere to be found: not in Synaptic Package Manager, apt-get install says thunderbird or mozilla-thunderbird is not available. Am I missing a source in /etc/apt/sources.list?

I tried manually installing the latest Thunderbird from mozilla.com: downloading the tar.gz, etc. When I start /opt/thunderbird/thunderbird, it says it can't find libstdc++.so.5. Gutsy has libstdc++.so.6. I tried creating a link from so.5 to so.6 and I got a different error when I started thunderbird.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks.

It's available for me.  Can you post your sources.list file?
```
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Oh, I uncommented these and I got Thunderbird. I guess during the install my net connection was spotty?

You guessed right. You don't need to download the official mozilla.com release. Updates will be available as long as both thunderbird 2.0 and Ubuntu Gutsy will be supported by their own creators.

I wasn't sure if I should start a new thread since the problem seems to have been resolved for rlelina.

Thunderbird is not available for me either but my source list appears to be complete with nothing commented out, so I don't know why that would be. Any further suggestions?

I know that I can download and install it from Mozilla but I would much rather do this directly from Ubuntu.

Thanks

Just to verify, here is my sources.list file
