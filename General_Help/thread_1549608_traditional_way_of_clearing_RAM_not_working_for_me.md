I've been using Digikam and it's a huge blow to my system memory.  Even after quitting I still feel my computer to be slightly slower.


I tried running the commands from
[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=589975](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=589975)

but I get this instead

bash: /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches: Permission denied


any ideas?

sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

```

what does the output # mean?

this should work, output will be "3" on the second command
```
 sudo -s
sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
exit
 
```
