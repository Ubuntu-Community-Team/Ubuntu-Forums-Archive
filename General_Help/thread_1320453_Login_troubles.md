I have a problem with the login screen on Xubuntu,

Around every other time I start up my computer the login screen never actually shows up but goes to a console that asks me to log in instead - then after I login with the text based console I have to run the command startx to run X, but then a short few moments after that the login screen shows up! I've tried waiting at the console login to see if the login screen shows up but it doesn't - you have to login through that, startx, and then wait for the login screen to show up and log in again.

Does anybody know why this is happening? I can clarify if this doesn't make much sense (I'm not the best at explaining things).
And also, when ever it tells me to login through the console, and then it goes to the login screen, after I log in, the nm-applet (Network Manager in taskbar) says the NetworkManagerUserSettings is in use and doesn't start unless I restart my computer until I reach the login screen instead of logging in through the console.

When this happens, does the display blink at all before the login prompt appears?

Did you change your display manager script? (I think it's /etc/init.d/xdm)

What's in your /etc/X11/default-display-manager file?

Thanks for your reply - During the loading screen it flashes and then instead of showing me the loading screen it shows me a log of whats doing,its continuing the bootup process in text mode (telling me what its configuring, like in Puppy Linux) and not just showing a loading screen.

I can't find the xdm file but in the Default-Display-Manager it says GDM is the manager.

Usually I the screen blinks from console to Login Screen when it works - and I can see that it still shows me the console login but then on the same line it says to put my username it says starting GDM - i noticed that when it just goes straight to the console login it never starts GDM.

It sounds like your X server doesn't start reliably.

Try to catch it acting up, then log in in text mode and grab a copy of the Xorg log

```
cp /var/log/Xorg.0.log ~/X-messed-up.log
```

Then run ```
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
```

and post the copied log file.

And doing the sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart didn't do much - it just restarted X it seems -  and it didn't bring back nm-applet.

That appears to be a log from where it worked perfectly.

You need to capture a log where it failed (drops you at the text console login).

When that happens, have you tried flipping to vt7? (Ctrl-Alt-F7)

---

### Post by JustinR on 2009-11-09
This is the log from when it goes to console - X never loads, I have to start it manually.

When it drops me to the console to login, I login and it tells me to find documentation go here and then it just says justin@xubuntu-fd>.

Then I put Start x, it goes to the desktop and then a couple minutes later is closes all the applications and goes to the Login screen successfully.

And I've never tried CTRL + ALT + F7

That log says X started just fine and, by the time you made a copy of the log, X was still running just fine.

Something else is happening here. Maybe you're getting stuck on vt1 for some reason. Try the flip to vt7 next time this happens.


Worst-case, you could use the duct-tape fix: add a line to the end of /etc/rc.local that calls ```
/etc/init.d/gdm stop
sleep 2
/etc/init.d/gdm start
```

See what I mean about duct tape?

### Post by JustinR on 2009-11-09
Okay I'll try thanks - I'll report back later when I get back.

---

### Post by JustinR on 2009-11-09
Okay, so it put me in the terminal again and CTRL + ALT + F7 didn't do anything - and if it does get into the worst-case scenario I'll try the duct tape fix!


Edit: I logged out and pressed CTRL-ALT-F1 and it took me to the same console login, I tried the CtrlAltF7 and it switched to the GUI so I don't know why the CtrlAltF7 keys don't seem to work when it loads me into the console instead of GUI at bootup.

---

### Post by JustinR on 2009-11-10
Bump &:

So far I know Xubuntu doesn't drop me to the console it actually goes there during bootup, but it doesn't actually freeze - it just sits there for around a minute, and then loads the Login screen - but on normal boot ups it just flys by the console login.

---

### Post by nerdy_kid on 2009-11-10
i think i had a similar issue (i didnt let it sit long enough to see if gdm would start)

i linked /usr/bin/gdm to
/usr/sbin
/bin
/sbin

i read somewhere that its looking for gdm in the wrong place, theres a fix for the gdm script in /etc/init.d, but i just skiped that fix and linked gdm everywhere...probaly stupid but it works for me!

---

### Post by JustinR on 2009-11-11
That would probably work but I think it's waiting on a command now - whenever I wait around two minutes after getting stuck at the console during bootup it says "Starting init Crypto disks..." and then loads fine. 

I can't find a bootup log so I can't be for sure if that was the command but thats the only one I saw.
