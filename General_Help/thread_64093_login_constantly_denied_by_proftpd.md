I set up proftp using frodon's howto.  I'm trying to login to my proftpd server from the same computer and I'm using Places -> Connect to server.  

The problem is whenever I try to connect it tells me that my login is incorrect.  

I went through the steps to set up a user (I called it ftpuser) and I set a password.  Here is my proftpd.conf file

I've been looking around and I haven't been able to find an answer to this particular problem.  If log info would be usefull I might need a quick tutorial on that.  Thanks.
