Hi there.  I just installed Lucid Beta 2 -- fresh install on a fresh machine -- and I can't seem to make gwibber work.  It crashes when I try to launch it from the main menu and from the me menu.  And when I try to launch it via a terminal, it returns the following errors:

> ** (gwibber:2941): WARNING **: Trying to register gtype 'WnckWindowState' as enum when in fact it is of type 'GFlags'

** (gwibber:2941): WARNING **: Trying to register gtype 'WnckWindowActions' as enum when in fact it is of type 'GFlags'

** (gwibber:2941): WARNING **: Trying to register gtype 'WnckWindowMoveResizeMask' as enum when in fact it is of type 'GFlags'
** Message: secret service operation failed: The name org.freedesktop.secrets was not provided by any .service files

gnomekeyring.IOError


Any help would be greatly appreciated.
