Greetings
I am completely new to Linux and have no idea what i am doing... 

that being said, I am trying to share files from a desktop running Ubuntu 11.04 so that they may be seen from a Laptop running Ubuntu 11.04 which are on the same network. 

I have tried installing Samba, which worked fine until i replaced windows on the laptop with Ubuntu. then the Laptop would not recognize any computers on the network. as i tried to search through the forums and solve the problem myself i think i may have also edited my smb.conf file in a way that it will no longer allow me to share the folder ( which used to be shared) on the desktop. 

just let me know what else i need to post to help troubleshoot the problem.
I appreciate any help i can get :)

EDIT: if it helps when i right click on the folder, and try to create share i get:
 'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare add: cannot convert name "everyone" to a SID. Invalid parameter.

Is user "everyone" an ubuntu user?
if so make sure that "everyone" is a samba user?(Add a Linux user to samba as root with smbpasswd -a "new user name")
You need to add the user first to linux and then samba.
You could post your smb.conf file so we can see what you have going on in there.

ok, i tried adding user everyone with the line you added. but got "Failed to add entry for user everyone."

here is the smb.conf file on my desktop which contains the folder i want to be shared.

etc/samba/smb.conf







#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors. 
# A well-established practice is to name the original file
# "smb.conf.master" and create the "real" config file with
# testparm -s smb.conf.master >smb.conf
# This minimizes the size of the really used smb.conf file
# which, according to the Samba Team, impacts performance
# However, use this with caution if your smb.conf file contains nested
# "include" statements. See Debian bug #483187 for a case
# where using a master file is not a good idea.

Hi, you are trying to crack an nut with a steamroller.

samba is for sharing with windows, if both boxes are running ubuntu forget about it.

On both computers, install openssh-server
```

sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```

Go to an empty workspace (no apps or windows open). In the global menu (the bar at the top) choose File > Connect to server

In the top box choose ssh

In the second box put the ip address of the other computer

forget the port

In the folder box put the path to the folder you want to access. You can just put / so that you have access to the other computers entire file system

Put your username on the other computer in the user name box

Give it a bookmark name then click connect.

You will have to type your password for the account on the other computer.

Choose to remember the password forever.

Do it the other way around on the other computer.

Now there will be a bookmark in the sidebar of your filebrowser for ever more which you can click and access the other computer from.

figures i would be doing it the hard way...

so now i installed the openssh on both machines, on the laptop i filled out the information and got the error.

Could not display "sftp://khalil@*myipaddress*/home/khalil/Linux_Shared".
Access was denied.

for the IP address i used whatismyip.com (not sure how to display it in terminal yet, something similar to ipconfig i assume) and both computers actually have the same username, not sure if that would be a problem or not...

If you want to fix samba:
>   'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare add: cannot convert name "everyone" to a SID. Invalid parameter.     Edit smb.conf as root:
```
gksu gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf
```Find the following section:
> # You may wish to use password encryption. See the section on
# 'encrypt passwords' in the smb.conf(5) manpage before enabling.
[COLOR=Blue]encrypt passwords = no[/COLOR]
And change the no to a yes:
```
encrypt passwords = yes
```Then save smb.conf, exit gedit, and back in the terminal restart samba:
```
sudo service smbd restart
```Wait a few minutes for the network to settle down and try it again.

BTW: There are 2 methods of creating a samba share and it appears you are using both. The nautilus method is where you are getting the error and "Everyone" does not refer to a specific user. The encryption error will affect both methods.

[COLOR=Blue]**EDIT**: Just noticed that you have the exact same error on your other machine. So you need to fix the encrypt line on that one as well.[/COLOR]

Open a terminal on the machine the client machine type ```
ssh username@ipaddress
```
to find the ip address type ```
ifconfig]
``` on that machine

When you connect with ssh it will ask you to save a key 

Then you will be able to sftp from nautilus

Lol, you should only use the public IP if you're trying to access the computer from somewhere outside your network, such as from work. In which case you have to have port forwarding setup. Instead just pop open the computer with the files on it, open a terminal, type ifconfig and use the ip assiciated with ETH0 for a wired network or wlan0 for a wireless network. 
 
Whatsmyip.com gives you the public IP... inother words what the rest of the world sees your connection to your ISP as, since i'm assuming your network is NAT'ed like everyone else's is by default. The IP you're looking for should be something in the 192.168.*.* range.

Thanks a lot, i can now view the shared folders on the linux machines. onces i had SSH installed i used the wrong IP, ifconfig fixed that for me. 

I will try changing the code as you suggest in case i want to connect again with my wondows machine in the future but for now this solves it

Thanks a lot for all your help :)

EDIT: just tested the change to the smb.conf file and my windows machine can view the linux shared folder as well.

Yeah, sorry should have been more clear.

Just your local ip address.

You can see that by right clicking the network icon an selecting connection information.
