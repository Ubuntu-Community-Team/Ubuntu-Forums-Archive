I am fairly new to Ubuntu and am now getting this error every time I run the Synaptic Package manager.  I also just tried to use 
sudo apt-get install alien
and it says it cannot fine it.

Here is the error:
W: Couldn't stat source package list [http://archive.ubuntu.com](http://archive.ubuntu.com) breezy/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy_universe_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)

How do I fix this???

Thanks

In synaptic try reload package information, which I think is the same as apt-get update, and see if that corrects/updates your sources. Hope that helps.
