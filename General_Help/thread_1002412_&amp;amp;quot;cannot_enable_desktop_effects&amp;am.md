title: "&amp;amp;quot;cannot enable desktop effects&amp;amp;quot;"

Hi all.

I just installed an ATI Radeon x550 into my ubuntu box.

I installed the restricted drivers via synaptic, and I then attempted to enable desktop effects.

The screen flashed for a moment, and then a message appeared in a dialog box, saying "desktop effects cannot be enabled".

This is a bit of a pain. 
I've gotten really used to the desktop cube, finding it a productivity booster.

How can I troubleshoot this issue, and get my cube back?

Thanks

Try: **ALT-F2** and enter ```
compiz --replace
```
If that doesn't work, go to: **Main Menu > System > Administration > Hardware Drivers**, and check if your graphic card is enabled or not.

Hiya.

According to the Hardware Drivers option, the restricted drivers for the card are indeed enabled.
I ran 'compiz --replace' from the dialog, and then again attempted to enable advanced effects in Appearance.

I got the same unsuccesful result.

I tried running 'compiz --replace' from the terminal, and got a segfaul with a huge splurge of information. I think the window manager might have crashed as well, because the decorators were gone, and I couldn't select the windows anymore.

What could be going wrong here?
How can I trobleshoot further ?



         ----edit----

I tried again from gnome-term. This time the window manager didn't crash.
This was the output from the term:

mantis@faustina:~$ compiz --replace

 ---edit---

Gah. Keyboard failed to work, so I had to stop my editing.
Anyway, I can't tell what's going on here, but I find the output interesting.
It seems to be looking for an nVidia something.
My previous card was an nVidia.
I actually pulled out my nVidia card, and installed the current one because I couldn't get desktop effects happening, (and the drivers from have horrid bugs).

Any idea whats happening here?

Sorry for my late reply.
All that I can think of now, is to reinstall compiz, and see if that solves it. I've come across some other posts, where people reinstalled, and were good to go.
If you don't want to reinstall, then please be patient until a more knowledgeable person can help you out.
What nvidia card are you using btw.

Um, thats the thing.
I'm not using an nVidia card.
I was using one, but I couldn't get compiz working with GF6800XT.
So, I removed it and installed an ATI Radeon X550.

I will try to uninstall and re-install compiz.

--edit--

uninstalling and reinstalling did not work.

Have you tried getting the drivers directly from ATI and installing them manually?  I could never get my Nvidia card to work with the preinstalled drivers. Give that a shot.  

P.S.  Make sure to remove the drivers that came with Ubuntu so there's no conflict.

If I understand the situation correctly, the drivers are installed and working.
In Administration->Hardware, the dialog tells me that the drivers are active.
And I can run amdcccle, which I believe comes with the driver.
Sure, it segfaults half the time, but it is present.

The problem is that I can't get the advanced desktop effects to become active.

Have you tried running [Compiz check]("http://forlong.blogage.de/entries/pages/Compiz-Check")?  That might give you a bit more info on exactly where the issue lies.

### Post by stinger30au on 2008-12-05
all of these issues would be gone if the ubuntu developers added a startup like[ mandriva 2009 one]("http://www.mandriva.com/en/product/mandriva-linux-one") and let you select compiz upon startup of the live cd and let you test it from the cd before you even install it to your hdd.

Could you please propose that to the developpers?

What graphics driver are you using ? fglrx ? try using the radeon driver and see what happens. [[COLOR="Red"]Compiz-check[/COLOR]]("http://forlong.blogage.de/entries/pages/Compiz-Check") may help. Please post your xorg.conf file.

Yes, I've run compiz-check.
It gave me a list of OK's.

So, I gotten to the point where the ATI driver is installed and running, and I have the capacity to run compiz.

And compiz fails to run.

There must be a step in between the two that is missing.

Hi Forlong.
I'm pretty sure it's the latest version. I downloaded it a few hours ago.

$ bash compiz-check --version

### Post by Kevbert on 2008-12-05
It's an ATI X550.  The fglrx driver is probably the problem as it doesn't seem to work with many models of ATI card.

All that nvidia stuff is a bit worrying.
I removed my nVidia card and the driver before I installed the Radeon.
Could there be a problem due to residual files from my previous hardware configuration?

### Post by Forlong on 2008-12-05
Alright, remove those obsolete config files:
```
sudo dpkg --purge nvidia-glx-177 nvidia-settings
```
Then remove the fglrx driver:
```
sudo apt-get purge xorg-driver-fglrx
```
Afterwards, reset your xorg.conf
```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
```
Then **reboot** and run Compiz-Check
Post the output here.

I went through the process and this is the output:
I'm not sure what this means.
But also, the ATI driver is no longer active.

Where to from here?
Do I re-activate the driver and try to get compiz running again?

check if your kernel line in your grub/menu.lst additional [force vesa] words. remove it if it is there
run X -configure at a vt after stopping the gdm.
sheck if you have vga installed.
what resolution you get now?
does it say your desktop does not allow transparency?

I'm confused. Did you reboot in the meantime or not?
Because it still says fglrx is loaded.

Sorry.
After I rebooted, I ran compiz-check. Of course, the script reported that I  have "no rendering method", so I figured that the next logical step was t reload the module.
I went ahead and reloaded it.

compiz-check now reports that now have the resources to run compiz.
But when I try to load advanced desktop settings the screen flashes and the dialog returns, telling me that the effects could not be enabled.

Is there even a solution to this?
I've been googling and trying different things for days now, and I'm tearing my hair out.
I haven't even been able to determine where the problem is.
Is it a problem or bug in compiz, xorg, the X550 card, or something related to ubuntu?

I would re-install and set everything up again from scratch, but my recent re-install did not solve the problem. I'll even install a different *nix or a bsd or something in order to fix this. 
I went out and bought the x550 because I couldn't get the desktop effects working on my nvidia GF6800XT.

I know that this all seems like relatively extreme measures, but after having the cube taken away from me is damn frustrating.

It's written for Hardy, but may give you a few pointers.

Hi Kevbert.
Thanks for that link.
I've just gone through it.
I'll read it closely again, and see if I can follow the process.
I'll report back the results.

Fail.

I managed to install the drivers from the ATI provided driver available from their site.

I then made the adjustments to my xorg.conf, as instructed by the page:
[http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=6794](http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=6794)

I rebooted.

I then got the horrid low-resolution mode and it's accompanying dialogs.
So, I ran 'dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg' as root to get usable resolution back.

Back to square one.

Here is the log:

### Post by Forlong on 2008-12-06
I'm sorry to say, you keep posting the wrong logs, which makes it very hard to follow what you are doing.
The only log that matters is the one when actually experiencing the error.

I understand this may be frustrating for you but the way you are trying to solve this issue makes it almost impossible to give you any support whatsoever.


Let me give you some info on your case:

Those are the important system specs:
> ```
 Distribution:          Ubuntu 8.10
 Desktop environment:   GNOME
 Graphics chip:         ATI Technologies Inc RV370 [Sapphire X550 Silent]
```

As a matter of fact, you should be able to get desktop effects out-of-the-box.
The RV370 is supported by the open radeon driver, which comes pre-installed on Ubuntu. (There is a bug in Intrepid that might tell you, you'll have to install the proprietary fglrx driver but that's not the case.)

The chip is also supported by ATI's official fglrx driver.
If you want to use that one, install/enable it via *System &#8594; Administration &#8594; Hardware Drivers*


Right. Why any of that failed, I don't know.
This is one of the very rare cases where I think starting from scratch may be not so bad of an idea. Is that an option for you?

If so, **do not try to install or enable anything after the installation process**. The first thing you do is download Compiz-Check and run it. Post its output here. No matter what it tells you.

If it does tell you that everything is alright (and you are impatient), run
```
compiz
```
from a command line. If anything fails, post the output here.

**Then** update all the packages you will be prompted by Ubuntu.
Still, do not "enable" the fglrx driver (yet).
If you have to reboot, do so. Then run
```
compiz
``` in the terminal again.
If it (still or again) doesn't work, post the output here.

I think that will keep you occupied until we hear from each other again. Then we can think about enabling the fglrx driver.

 Hope all goes well.

I found yet another resource, with yet another way to get this kind of card working: 
[http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Talk:Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide](http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Talk:Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide)

Alas, this method doesn't work for me either.
I got dumped into low res mode on boot, and a dialog error message saying something about screens not being available.

I'm past wits end.
Re-installing ubuntu and adding a new card have both failed.

Are there any alternatives to nVidia and ATI cards?
Getting a new card again feels like a completely depressing defeat,
but I need to get decent video working.

And as soon as I do, I'm going to smash this crappy X550 into splinters with a brick.

You might have missed my last posting, so have a look at the bottom of the previous site of this thread.


P.S. before you are smashing any graphics cards, please send them to me, I sure can need them. I'd also take the Nvidia, 'cause my ATI Radeon 9600XT is even (way) crappier. :D

hello there, i updated my system  yesterday and for the update i turned off compiz and after that i cant switch it on again, tried to reinstall the drivers for my graphic card   (ati radeon X1800) but i think i did something wrong :( tried to reinstall compiz but i failed again...

now when i type compiz into terminal it xames out this:

compiz (core) - Error: Screen 0 on display ":0.0" already has a window manager; try using the --replace option to replace the current window manager.
compiz (core) - Fatal: No manageable screens found on display :0.0

what can i do now?

As I originally pointed out and Forlong also mentioned you should try the radeon driver which comes by default with Ubuntu. The fglrx driver is a bit of a problem with some ATI cards (and by the sound of it your X550). What you'll need to do is to try removing the fglrx software driver and try the 'radeon' or 'ati' driver. I've attached my xorg.conf file (ati driver used, I'm using a radeon 9000 mobility in my laptop) and compiz works fine in Ubuntu and Xubuntu.
Part of the reason that you're having problems is due to the fact that a lot of changes have been made to the Ubuntu drivers and due to a bug in the ATI software some cards are blacklisted when it comes to 3D graphics acceleration.
Good luck, perseverance is a virtue.

Thank you for your patience.
I did indeed miss that post.

So, as suggested, I'm starting from scratch.

I removed the propritry driver, ran apt-get purge xorg-driver-fglrx and rebooted.
After boot, I get dumped into low res mode.
This time, doing 'dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg', and killing X doesn't help: I'm stuck in low res mode.

When I press 'Y', the restricted hardware dialog appears and tells me that I can install the flgrx driver. (the one that I've just unloaded.)


I went ahead and re-installed the restricted driver via synaptic.
From the terminal, I then ran compiz.
Here is the output:

> As I originally pointed out and Forlong also mentioned you should try the radeon driver which comes by default with Ubuntu. The fglrx driver is a bit of a problem with some ATI cards (and by the sound of it your X550). What you'll need to do is to try removing the fglrx software driver and try the 'radeon' or 'ati' driver. I've attached my xorg.conf file (ati driver used, I'm using a radeon 9000 mobility in my laptop) and compiz works fine in Ubuntu and Xubuntu.
Part of the reason that you're having problems is due to the fact that a lot of changes have been made to the Ubuntu drivers and due to a bug in the ATI software some cards are blacklisted when it comes to 3D graphics acceleration.
Good luck, perseverance is a virtue.

Hi kevbert.

I gave that a try.
I uninstalled the restricted driver, and installed the ati driver.
I then used your xorg.conf.
I rebooted, and had no video output.
So, I ssh'd into my desktop, removed the driver, reconfigured my xorg and rebooted. 
I was back on low res, so I used synaptic to re-install the flgrx driver.

After all the generous here, and much tinkering I've finally managed to enable desktop effects.

I'm really not sure how I did it in the end. 
I just kept uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers via apt-get, and letting aticonfig edit my xorg.conf.

I have my cube back.

I'd really like to post how I was able to get a successful result in the end, but I'm not sure how I did it.

In case it is helpful to others, here are the files of my current, successful, setup:

compiz-check reports:

I gather that the xorg.conf above can be further optimised with the edition of options for all that 3D jiggery pokery that is beyond my understanding. (I'm just happy with my functioning cube)

Let me know if I can post anything other config info that could be helpful.

Thanks for the help guys. Much appreciated.

Good to hear that you finally got the cube back again. Is it possible that you're using a newer version of the fglrx driver ?

Given that I was using apt, and that I've been installing and uninstalling and reinstalling, then that could be a possibility.
Is there a way to check ?

---

### Post by Kevbert on 2008-12-07
The only way I know is to make a note of the version that's initially installed via apt as it's normally in the filename. To get the current version just go to Synaptic and search for fglrx and it will give you the version that's currently installed.

---

### Post by Forlong on 2008-12-07
```
fglrxinfo
```
will give you the version number

---

### Post by Kevbert on 2008-12-07
If you need to check a version of an old installed piece of software such as fglrx you can do this by looking at an old term.log (provided that it has not been overwritten) with the following commands
```
cd /var/log/apt
sudo gzip -d term.log.1.gz
sudo gedit term.log.1
```
The first command takes you to the directory where all the updates are logged. The next command extracts the compressed file and saves it in the /var/log/apt directory. This file is the previous update log file, so term.log.2 would be the one before that (etc). Finally the editor opens the uncompressed file and you can search (using find) for a previously installed package (in this case fglrx).

It seems that my currently installed version is 
xorg-driver-fglrx 2:8.552-0ubuntu0.1

Thanks to the guys who contributed to this thread and helped me get my desktop cube back.

I conclude that there probably wasn't anything unique about my system that stopped me from getting advanced desktop effects. I just kept hammering away, removing and installing and re-installing drivers and configs until one worked.

### Post by bobdobbs on 2008-12-29
Hi guys.

The problem is now worse.


I just got back from a few days away from home.
I booted my desktop. Before GDM starts, I get a dialogue, saying that X can only start in low resolution mode.

Crap! I stop giving ubuntu my attention for a few days, and it throws a fit!

So, I try a few things.

I drop to a terminal, and replace the xorg.conf to a backed up one from about two weeks ago. Reboot.
Same message.

I logged into X in low graphics mode, and I go to Administration->Hardware drivers.
I see that the module is no longer enabled. 
How did that happen?
I enable it. Reboot

Same "low graphics" message"

I drop to a term, run:
 dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
reboot.

I'm still in low graphics mode.

So, I log in, in low graphics mode, and go the "hardware drivers" section.
I see a message saying something like
"This driver is enabled. but is not being used"

Now I'm confused again.

How I do "use" the driver once I've enabled it?

Something is unstable here, and I don't know if its the driver or X, or my fragile mind.

How do I get X to work with the ATI drivers and compiz?
Is ubuntu capable of running X with ATI and compiz without periodicall falling over?

update -

I couldn't figure out how to get anywhere near a usable resolution with teh ATI card, so I replaced it with the GF card again.

Now, I have usable resolution again  - but no desktop effects.

So, I'm back to square one.
(And really pissed off at xorg for being so unpredictable)

If I try to enable desktop effects, I get the dialog that says "desktop effects cannot be enabled" with no explanation or pointers again.

This is my output from compiz-check:

How can I regain desktop effects ?

Hi Forlong.
Thanks for jumping in again.
However, I'm away from my desktop, and I'll be camping for the next few days.
I'll respond properly as soon as I get back.

Heppy holidays.

Hi Forlong.

I got back from holiday yesterday.
When I booted my PC, the resolution had crapped out again.

So now, I'm using the nvidia card without a driver for it.
back to square one.

The output of compiz-check is:

athering information about your system...

 Distribution:          Ubuntu 8.10
 Desktop environment:   GNOME
 Graphics chip:         nVidia Corporation NV42 [GeForce 6800 XT] (rev a2)
 Driver in use:         nv
 Rendering method:      None

Checking if it's possible to run Compiz on your system...  [SKIP]

 Checking for hardware/setup problems...           [SKIP]

At least one check had to be skipped:
 Error: No rendering method in use (AIGLX, Xgl or Nvidia) 

Would you like to know more? (Y/n) y

 The nv driver is not capable of running Compiz, you need to install
 the proper driver for your graphics card. 

Check if there's an alternate (proprietary) driver available? (Y/n) 

```

Of course, if I enable the nvidia driver, the resolution goes back to being unusably low.

OK, let's try to solve this the hard way.
First of all, get rid of all driver related packages (don't worry, we'll install the nvidia ones again afterwards):
```
sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx-modaliases nvidia-173-modaliases nvidia-177-kernel-source nvidia-177-modaliases nvidia-71-modaliases nvidia-96-modaliases nvidia-common nvidia-glx-173 nvidia-glx-177 nvidia-glx-96 nvidia-settings xorg-driver-fglrx
```
Please post the output of that here.


Edit: also please post your current /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Hm... try this:
```
sudo dpkg -P nvidia-177-kernel-source nvidia-glx-173 nvidia-glx-177 nvidia-glx-96 nvidia-settings xorg-driver-fglrx

```
What's the output?

And also ```
dpkg -l | grep "nvidia\|fglrx"
```

Good, now run
```
sudo apt-get purge nvidia-96-kernel-source
```
Afterwards:
```
sudo apt-get install nvidia-common
```
Finally go to *System &#8594; Administration &#8594; Hardware Drivers* and see if there's a driver to enable for you.

If so, enable, reboot and see if it helped.

After doing these things, I am back to having low resolution and no compiz.

When I got to System &#8594; Administration &#8594; Hardware Drivers, I chose the latest available driver in the menu: the version 177 driver.

But, being back to square one in this case is probably a good thing. In theory I can start from scratch.



This is my current xorg.conf
```

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Default Screen"
	Monitor		"Configured Monitor"
	Device		"Configured Video Device"

	DefaultDepth	24
EndSection

	Load	"glx"
EndSection

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Configured Video Device"
	Driver	"nvidia"
	Option	"NoLogo"	"True"
EndSection

```

I then ran compiz-check, and got this:
```

```

When I press y, it takes me back to the ubuntu menu that allows me to select a driver.

However, as the dialog confirms, I am indeed already using the 177 driver.

Where to from here?

Well, then the dialog's wrong, you are not using that driver, you are on vesa, which is the failsafe driver of Linux. It works with any hardware but can't do much else, of course.
> **bobdobbs said:**

I don't know. It's obviously a driver problem, nothing to do with Compiz.
So you might want to start a new thread and make clear you are having troubles with setting up the right driver for your Nvidia card.

Sorry, I can't be of more help at the moment. Everything's set up right, so it *should* be working.

Ok. I'll do that.
