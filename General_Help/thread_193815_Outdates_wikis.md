Hi

Most wikis i try to follow dont seem to work as when I type the package names in synaptic package manager, half of the time it comes up with nothing.

For example, I can't follow the wiki in the following link because a lot of the packages are no longer available!

[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats)

As you can see from my sources.list everything is enabled, so why is so much missing from ubuntu 6.06 when it was available in 5.10?
