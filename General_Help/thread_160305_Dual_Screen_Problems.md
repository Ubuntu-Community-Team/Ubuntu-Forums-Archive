Hello,

I have some problems configuring a dualscreen enviroment with ubuntu/gnome.

Hardware:
As mainscreen i have a flatpanel (DFP) (Samsung Synmaster)
As second screen i have an old CRT (noname 17")

the crt is on the left side and only on when needed (when developing).

The Problems:
* The CRT is somehow defined as primary screen, resulting in:
** The Loginscreen apears on the CRT
** New windows are opened on the CRT

Question: How to change this behaviour to set the DFP as primary screen (or how it is called), so the CRT is just more "space" on the screen.
