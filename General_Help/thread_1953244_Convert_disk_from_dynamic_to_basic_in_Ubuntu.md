During installation of Ubuntu my hard disk got seriously screwed up so it somehow managed to install Ubuntu and then convert itself into a dynamic disk. Are there any tools for converting partitions from dynamic to basic without data loss in Ubuntu?

Ubuntu could not have converted to dynamic disk. That is a Windows proprietary system that only works in Windows.

Converting back to basic is a high risk activity. While it may work, you must back up all important data. Windows specifies that you backup erase entire drive & totally reinstall.

Works best if you do have have a lot of dynamic partitions and they all can be converted back to primary. I now believe that Parititon Wizard free version does not include the conversion from dynamic, but EASEUS free version does.

Dynamic volume is a Microsoft proprietary format developed together with Veritas (now acquired by Symantec) for logical volumes.
You may be use a third-party tool, such as Partition Wizard MiniTool or EASEUS to convert a convert a dynamic disk to a basic disk without having to delete or format them.
The Partition Wizard software for Windows is supposed to be able to convert dynamic disks to regular partitions without data loss, so it may be what you need to get around this problem; however, I've never used it and so I can't be sure it will work.

Several users have used this, it has a liveCD download to use:
MiniTool Partition Wizard Professional Edition 5.2 to convert without loss of data the disk from dynamic disk to a basic disk.
also used Partition Wizard to set an existing partition logical instead of primary

Converted from dynamic with MiniTool, & repaired windows
