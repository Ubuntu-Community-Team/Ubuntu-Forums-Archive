I just downgraded from amd64 to i386 because my wi-fi card doesn't have 64bit drivers. Now ubuntu only detects one processor on my machine (core 2 duo).  
I read that I have to install linux-generic kernel, which has been done. However, when I boot generic  from grub, I get an Xserver crash after GDM is launched... This isin't the case with the 2.6.17-10-386 kernel.
Can anyone help me get both cpu's detected ?

Problem solved. The problem was that the xserver failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module I had installed with previous kerne (via Automatix2). Isimple uninstalled the hardware accel from automatix and rebooted inlinux-generic. Both CPUS pop up on system monitor :D 
Now to get the hardware accelleration back up.... Will post back

Hmmm... I can't seem to get 3d accel back up... Im getting very low fsw with glxgears. As soon as I reinstall nvidia-glx, I get xserver crash on reboot.... 
here is my xorg.conf
