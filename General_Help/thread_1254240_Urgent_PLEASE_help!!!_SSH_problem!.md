Hi guys,

I'm having a networking problem and i sincerely hope you can help me to solve this.

Basically, I have a LAN of 5 computers with SSH setup for all of them. They are all supposed to be able to SSH into each other using public key authentication with no problems

Problem is that from my machine, (call it A), I can SSH into the other 4 with no trouble at all. The other 4 can also SSH into each other with no problems too, but they can't SSH into mine!

I've tried pinging my machine (A) from other machines (B - E) and they can all ping. However, when I use nmap to probe my machine (A), it returns a message saying that "Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -PN"...

Then I tried nmap on from my on machine (A) using both "nmap localhost" and "nmap 192.168.1.70" and they both work fine and finds my SSH daemon listening on port 22.

I've also check my sshd_config file is almost by default settings, just that I turned off password authentication and it has the same settings as the other four computers in my LAN anyway.

To me, it seems like a DNS problem but I have no idea how to go able solving it....


Please please help!

Thank you very much for your kind attention.

Best regards,

Michael

Here's what I got from "iptables -L" but I don't understand waht they mean...

Firstly, use the command line for debugging, not GUI programs, because you want to see the real error messages rather than sanitised GUI ones. Also, if you suspect DNS problems, try using IP addresses instead to verify the basic network connectivity.

You say that B-E can't log in to A. What is the error message for:
**ssh 192.168.1.70**
? Is it connection refused, timeout etc?

Actually, I would guess it is timeout, since there doesn't seem to be a rule in iptables to allow ssh. You could try disabling ufw to prove the point. I don't use ufw so don't know how to configure it to allow ssh in, but it should be fairly easy to figure out.

P.S.
This snippet:
[B]Chain ufw-before-output (1 references)
target prot opt source destination
ACCEPT all -- anywhere anywhere [/B]
appears to accept all incoming traffic, but that's probably not the case. If you use **sudo iptables -nvL** you will probably see that the rule only applies to traffic from interface l0.
