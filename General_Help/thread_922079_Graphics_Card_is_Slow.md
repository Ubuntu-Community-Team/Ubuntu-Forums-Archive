title: "Graphics Card is Slow"

### Post by baudday on 2008-09-16
Ever since I upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04, my graphics card is real slow, I can barely play armagetron. Also Rhythmbox will just randomly stop playing songs. It's just a complete mess. Does anyone know how I can fix this?

One possibility is to turn compiz off if it isn't already:
System --> Preferences --> Appearance
Visual Effects tab, then make sure the None radio box is selected.

make sure you're still loading the same driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

also check your xorg log for errors and warnings

```
 cat /var/log/xorg.0.log | grep EE

cat /var/log/xorg.0.log | grep WW
```

Although I do not exactly remember the xorg.conf file. This looks about right.

I'm sure that would make it faster, I'm trying to solve this problem without giving up anything I was using before. After all, it is an upgrade.

Ok, I don't have much experience with ATi gfx cards myself, so this might work for you:

Perhaps you just need newer ATi drivers installed.
There's a nice easy program that will download a recent version of your video drivers, and install them for you.
```
sudo aptitude install envyng-gtk
```
Once installed, you'll find it in Applications --> System Tools --> EnvyNG
Then follow the prompts.

Well, I ended up turning desktop effects. That improved it a bit, but not by much. And also, for some reason I don't get sound from youtube anymore. This is not what I was expecting at all when I upgraded.

When I look at the history in Synaptic I'm pretty sure this is the day of the upgrade:

```
Commit Log for Fri Sep 12 21:38:57 2008


Upgraded the following packages:
fgfs-base (0.9.10-1) to 1.0.0-1
python-twisted (2.5.0-2build1) to 2.5.0-2build2
python-twisted-conch (1:0.8.0-1) to 1:0.8.0-1build1
wesnoth-server (1.2.6-1ubuntu2.4) to 1:1.4-1

```

Anything in there maybe cause this?
