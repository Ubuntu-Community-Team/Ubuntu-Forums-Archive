Hello all,

I installed Lucid Lynx a month or so ago.  I have not had any problems until now.  I can hear sounds fine when I'm using Google Chrome but when I try to use MuseScore, no sound comes out.

When I go into Sound properties, and hardware, there are no devices shown, like in the screenshot attached.

When I go into the terminal and type in "aplay -l", I get:

aplay: device_list:223: no soundcards found...

Also, I get sound if I use the windows version of MuseScore through WINE but it crashes a lot.

Thanks for your help in advance.

EDIT: I did the commands "lspci" and "lsusb" and got the following:

Also I cannot hear anything in Ubuntu Movie Player or VLC Media Player.

My laptop is a HP Pavilion DV9823em.  It has a RealTek High Definition Sound Card, which was detected on windows, but not in Ubuntu.  I have also installed OSS, but am not using it.
