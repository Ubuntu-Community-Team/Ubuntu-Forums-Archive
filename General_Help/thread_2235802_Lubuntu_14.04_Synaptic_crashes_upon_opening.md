### Post by Chrisfs on 2014-07-23
Hi, 
I upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to Lubuntu 14.04 yesterday, When I launch Synaptic Package Manager, I get the following message and then it closes.   
E: Malformed line 58 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)
E: The list of sources could not be read.
Go to the repository dialog to correct the problem.
E: _cache->open() failed, please report.

I can never get to the repository dialog as the app closes immediately.

I can't get new apps through Lunbuntu Software Center either.  

Any ideas on what I can do ?

```

The issue resides in the line 58 of your **/etc/apt/sources.list** (the one I highlighted in red). You have an extra '/' in the url and you'll have to edit so it reads like this```
deb http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty
```

To achieve it open a terminal window and run the following command```
gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```It will open your sources file in read/write mode and all you have to do is to find that line, remove the extra '/', save and close the file and afterwards, again in the terminal run:```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Thanks, 
gedit wasn't installed (isn't in default lubuntu install?) , so I used leafpad instead. Same command only sub leafpad for gedit. 
I tried editing the line as you suggested, but I kept getting the same error, so I just commented out the line altogether and then the subsequent code you gave worked. I'll figure out what the proper url for that repository is later.

Yeah, the issue is with that url. Anyway I'm glad you got it working.
