I am sorry this might all sound a bit vauge.  I do not have a comoputer to write this post on at the momement, due to this problem so I can't make reference to actual computer

This is the 2nd time this has happened now. 

went to search for restricted hardware drivers using the tool in the system menu, I think it is call "restricted hardware"  and it recomended a nvidia driver.  Which I knew I had to install anyway to get my dual montitors working again. 

But after restarting I can not log in I just get boxes with radio contrals on them that basically say that I can not get an interface. 

I think I can nget to command line. 

I would just reinstall as I did last time I had this but I have a lot of files that I would not like to lose. 

In my expert opinion I belive that the Nvidia driver something went wrong with the Nvidia Driver

Maybe I can install the Nvidia driver in comand line?

```
sudo aptitude install nvidia-180-kernel-source nvidia-180-libvdpau nvidia-180-modaliases nvidia-common nvidia-settings -y && sudo nvidia-xconfig
```

Thankyou ptn

By the speed of your reply can I assume that is a common problem?

If you can't get to a working desktop with both monitors connected try disconnecting one of them & see if she'll boot to a GUI.
Then you can try to set up twinview. It's not a elegant way to do it, but they have changed the way the X server works & it seems to be kind of trail & error at the moment.
I guess what I'm trying to say is try 1 monitor to isolate the problem.

Thanks Dag 

Actualy I had not even started looking at Twinview, I had just installed the driver. 

But know I think back, I rememeber another bug that occured bothtimes, after I installed the driver it still said that the driver was avalible to download, so I think we jcould assume that the driver did not download correctly. 

And I just thought of another problem with these solutions, they me to download a solution, I just rememeber my computer is wireless, so unless I can workout away to connect to my wireless network from command line I might me back in the same boat. 
:confused:

OK Now I am getting really really upset, I just went out and bought a brand new computer, from top to bottom because i could not solve this problem. 

The only thing I reused from the old computer was the wifi card.

I got a motherboard with a built in Nvidia card.

And guess what i am having the same problem.

$700 down the drain 

I am really really upset 

The exact same problem 

After I restart the computer after install in the Nvidia driver from system>asdmin>hardware drivers 

The gnome desktop will not restart 

Can someone please help me I want to cry.

perhaps the problem is with the monitor(s) that are not detected properly and after installing the drivers, you're running a resolution / refresh rates they can't handle?

Can you get to a console pressing control+alt+F1 ?

As well as the output of:

Looks like the nvidia driver can't figure out what your monitor(s) can handle. What monitor(s) do you have ? Do you know its precise specs? We're gonna have to feed it the numbers in xorg.

listen the only thing Iknow about is that it is a lcd dell monitor with a vga output I think it is a 17"

---

### Post by Jason Weiss on 2009-08-22
I know this is not a lot of information

---

### Post by P4man on 2009-08-22
do you know what resolution it can handle? And what refresh rate? Doesn't it have a monitor type written on it somewhere (the back?) ? If the answer to all that is "no", then can you boot windows on that machine, so we can find out?

### Post by Jason Weiss on 2009-08-22
ok I found it 

res 1280 x 600

60 mhz

---

### Post by Jason Weiss on 2009-08-22
it says the current res is 800 x 600 60 hz

### Post by P4man on 2009-08-22
Thats an odd resolution indeed. More like a laptop display ?

Anyway, if you're sure about that, lets try this:
open xorg.conf in an editor. You can use gedit if you have gnome up and running:

> gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

 otherwise from a terminal type:

> sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Add the line I put in bold:

```

Section "Monitor"
Identifier "Configured Monitor"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
Identifier "Default Screen"
Monitor "Configured Monitor"
Device "Configured Video Device"
DefaultDepth 24
**Option "metamodes" "1280x600 +0+0" **
EndSection

Section "Module"
Load "glx"
EndSection

Section "Device"
Identifier "Configured Video Device"
Driver "nvidia"
Option "NoLogo" "True"
EndSection 
```

save (in nano, to save press control+X then confirm with Y)
reboot.
cross fingers
:)

no luck I still had the same result

I am sure the settings are correct

### Post by P4man on 2009-08-22
meh :(. Im no xorg.conf expert by any stretch of the imagination, so Im hoping someone else will chime in. Until then, another attempt:


```
Section "Monitor"
Identifier "Configured Monitor"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
Identifier "Default Screen"
Monitor "Configured Monitor"
Device "Configured Video Device"
DefaultDepth 24
[B] SubSection "Display"
        Depth        24
        Modes      "1280x600_60.00"
 EndSubSection[/B]
EndSection

Section "Module"
Load "glx"
EndSection

Section "Device"
Identifier "Configured Video Device"
Driver "nvidia"
Option "NoLogo" "True"
EndSection
```

Im pretty sure your problem is just this though; nvidia driver is not reading your monitor capabilities, so you have to manually set them.

edit: you could also try changing depth from 24 to 16 on both lines

### Post by Jason Weiss on 2009-08-22
Thnank you very much P4 man 

I found the answer /workaround for this

I just did a clean install and installed the 173 driver instead of the 180 driver.

Simple 

Thankyou very much for jsticking with my through this. 

It was a really stressful time.
