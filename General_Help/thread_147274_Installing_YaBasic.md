OR
if u want to do it using command line 
apt-get install yabasic

how do I change the 'ubuntu' part?Edit your /etc/hosts file

Installing an rpm on ubuntu? You should probably use alien if you want to do that. And using the --force and --nodeps switches? I'd be shocked if it did work.

Those error messages probably mean that the source is temporarily unavailable (happens all the time) or the files aren't where apt thinks they are. updatedb and try again later. apt is definately the preferred method to install. I'd recommend trying to get apt to work before anything else.

it wont let me edit it using the Text editor.. how do I edit it using the terminal?

apt-get isant working for yabasic at all, apt-get update works however.
