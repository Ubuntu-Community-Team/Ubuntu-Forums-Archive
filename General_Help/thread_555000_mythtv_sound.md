### Post by pnotequalsnp on 2007-09-19
I have been trying to get the sound capture to work with mythtv.  I have a FusionHDTV RT Gold card with the audio connected to the CD-in on the motherboard.  If I use mythtv without muting CD-in I get sound, but it is way off (sync) and I cannot adjust it.  I tried muting CD-in and setting it to capture but I have no audio in mythtv. 

Thanks for any help in advance!
