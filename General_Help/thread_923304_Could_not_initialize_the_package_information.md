Hi.
I'm running Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy. Since a few days ago, every time I try to use Synaptic to install packages or update anything I get this error message:

"Could not initialize the package information

A unresolvable problem occurred while initializing the package information.

Please report this bug against the 'update-manager' package and include the following error message:

'E:Malformed line 76 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (URI parse), E:The list of sources could not be read.'"

Anyone know what the deal is? Do I need to reformat? Thanks in advance.
