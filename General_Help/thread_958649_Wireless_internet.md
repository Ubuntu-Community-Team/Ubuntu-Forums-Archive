How do I get wireless on a laptop with Ubuntu 8.04?

find the correct divers related to your wireless chip, usually either broadcam, atheros, or intel 

run [highlight]lspci[/highlight] from terminal and your wireless chip should be defined after [highlight]Network Controller:[/highlight]

I have a feeling you might have one of their built in USB wireless cards. 
See if you can find it when you run lsusb. If so, upgrade to 8.10.
