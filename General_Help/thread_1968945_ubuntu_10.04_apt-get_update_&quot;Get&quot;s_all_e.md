Just in the last few days when I do an "apt-get update", it now downloads all the repositories every time.  That is, "Get"s are done instead of "Hit"s on repositories that have not changed.

I can do an "apt-get update" and then when it finishes, do another "apt-get update", and all the repositories refreshed with "Get"s.

Is anybody else seeing this happen to them?

Here is my /etc/apt/sources.list file:

```

# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS _Lucid Lynx_ - Release i386 (20100816.1)]/ lucid main restricted

# newer versions of the distribution.
