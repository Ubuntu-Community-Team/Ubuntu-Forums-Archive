Hi,
I have Lenovo Legion Y720 laptop.
I have KDE Plasma
This laptop has a HDMI port.

When I run ```
xrandr
``` it is not recognising the HDMI port.
Also, not finding it when run ```
sudo lshw -C display
```

This laptop had Windows prior, and the HDMI port was working fine with a monitor.

I recently wiped out Windows and installed Ubuntu 22.04.1.

Result from ```
xrandr
```

I see some similar issues online, but nothing has worked for me.
I am not sure where to turn next?

Thanks
