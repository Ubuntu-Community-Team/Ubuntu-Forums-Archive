I want to be able to boot Ubuntu from the blue win8 bootloader but its not working and no one seems to be able to help so im willing to compromise can I keep both where grub will load first and I can boot Ubuntu or my other os's  or choose windows 8 and boot into the win8 bootloader? I saw this on another thread somewhere but I cant find it. If I cant I could just use grub 2 gui but it'd be a shame to lose the win8 bootloader gui

Is your install UEFI or BIOS?
