Hello
I am trying to enable 3D acceleration on my computer, I have a nvidia 7900gs graphics card, and i used Envy to install the driver.  However, when i type
 ```
glxinfo | grep rendering
```
I get:
```
direct rendering: No
```
How can i enable direct rendering?  Here is my xorg.conf

```

Try:
```
sudo nvidia-xconfig --allow-glx-with-composite
```
And then CTRL-ALT-Backspace to restart your X session.

Try:

sudo nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals

And then CTRL-ALT-Backspace to restart your X session.
