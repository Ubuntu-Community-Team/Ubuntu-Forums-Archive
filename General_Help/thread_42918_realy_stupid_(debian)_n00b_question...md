I am using Uby 5.04. This is the first time I have really set down and started using a debian based distro in my many years of running linux.
But, can you belive I dont have a clue how to install a *.deb package.
Can anyone point me in the right direction on that info.
Thanks so much. I am trying to install GRIP.
Cheers,
Joey

Fire up:
System->Administration->Synaptic

Search for your application, and install :)
If you dont find it, add some repositories, for info on that check

dpkg -i *.deb
But grip is in universe, so maybe you should just enable that and install with synaptic/apt-get?

Thanks,
