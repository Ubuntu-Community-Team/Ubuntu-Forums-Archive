### Post by redsox59 on 2007-01-13
A little background info:
I ran into a problem with X server crashing while booting into gnome. I think it had something to do with my Nvidia drivers but I can't explain why that happened because I don't think I changed anything to cause an error.

So for my current situation:
I can boot into gnome and login and all. Keyboard has no problem. But mouse doesn't move or click.  I've got an Nvidia 6600  video card.

Here's the Log (had to cut it down to make it fit, hopefully enough is still there):
```

did you try to reconfigure the Xserver? sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

or 

Comment out any reference with wacom maybe that will help
