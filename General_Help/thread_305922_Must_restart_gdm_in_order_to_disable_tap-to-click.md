### Post by johandsome on 2006-11-24
Hi.  I'm running Ubuntu Edgy and have a weird problem with my touch pad.

I've disabled tap-to-click in xorg.conf by adding Option "TouchpadOff" "2", as seen in the code section under:
```

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Synaptics Touchpad"
        Driver          "synaptics"
        Option          "SendCoreEvents"        "true"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
        Option          "Protocol"              "auto-dev"
        Option          "TouchpadOff"           "2"
EndSection

```

This is not working perfectly, though.  Each time I reboot, and log in, tap-to-click is enabled.  However, after I restart gdm and log in a second time it usually is disabled (sometimes I'll have to do this twice).

What could be the reason for this?  It seems that all other settings is applied the first time I log in (such as disabling dead keys, etc.).

Perhaps this has anything to do with the other InputDevice?
```

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"
        Option          "Protocol"              "ExplorerPS/2"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"
EndSection

```

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Try setting "MaxTapTime" to zero, like this:
```
	Option		"MaxTapTime"		"0"
```

That will turn off the tapping.  If you have other problems or you want to play with other settings, try this site:

There is also plenty of help in the forums!
