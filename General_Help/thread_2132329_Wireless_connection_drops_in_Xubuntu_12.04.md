Hi,

My wireless connection drops every when I open the **qBittorrent 3.0.8**. I run Xubuntu 12.04.2 (x32) with all updates. I downgrade to 12.04 because it is LTS, but in 12.10 the connection not dropped.
My netbook is an Acer Aspire One 722.

Could you use Transmission as your torrent client?

Transmission is very simple. I don't like.
