I am using an HP laptop running ubuntu dapper 6.06. I have no sound and whenever i try to turn it on I get this:

The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured.

You can remove the volume control from the panel by right-clicking the speaker icon on the panel and selecting "Remove From Panel" from the menu.

you need to figure out if your sound card has been configured or the driver has been loaded. Open a terminal and use these commands.

```


sudo lspci


```

this should list your hardware and your sound card should be in the list.
here is what the output of mine looks like

```

notice the ((((( ))))) inside is my sound card take your sound card info and google it for the linux driver. or just head over to the alsa website 

```

http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main

```

and look up what driver your need. mine happens to be " snd_hda_intel"

then again at a terminal command prompt type

```

sudo lsmod

```

then look and see if your sound driver ( kernel module ) has been installed.
or just post it back here and someone will tell you.
