For the last week or so sometimes when i turn my computer on i will have no sound whatsoever other than a system beep i can't tell what is causing it. Sometimes restarting my computer fixes it however this is not always the case, does anyone know what could be causing it?

by "beep" I'm assuming you mean the one inside your computer (transducer)

Open up a terminal and type in "lspci" without quotes. the first letter is a lowercase L. post the output.

Im no expert here, so im afraid I won't be much help, but I do have some idea. This:

```
00:10.1 Audio device: nVidia Corporation MCP51 High Definition Audio (rev a2)
```

Is your audio device. Try googleing that and see if there is a driver to download. Also, this sounds silly, but is the audio plugged in? I was really annoyed at not having sound for a while, and found out that my audio cable had become inexplicably unplugged. Also try going to the volume control and making sure things are all turned up. Try system > administration > sound and take it a look at that. TRy some different options there.

Sorry if wasn't any help.

ill have a look for those drivers now, i don't think it can be unplugged audio anywhere as (a) its all internal stuff (im on a laptop) and (b) its an intermittent problem, somethimes it works sometimes it doesn't but thanks, it is always good to double check the basics, its normally where the problem lies, 

here is my output when the sound is working...

I see that you have an HD-sound driver-those can be pesky:

try:[http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php/TroubleShooting]("http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php/TroubleShooting")

Also try upgrading your BIOS to the latest version and upgrading to the latest release of your kernel through update manager.
