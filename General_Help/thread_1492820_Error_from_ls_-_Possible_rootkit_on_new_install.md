Heya guys,
    I just switched one of my servers over from debian lenny to lucid server 686 about 10 hours or so ago.
All was going seemingly well until I saw the following message during one of my ssh sessions (logged in as root)
```
ls: unrecognized prefix: rs
ls: unparsable value for LS_COLORS environment variable
```
Which I thought to be rather innocent looking but I went ahead and googled it.
Seeing a few mentions of rootkits being installed for people with similar errors, I went ahead and ran chkrootkit.
Here are the results:

You can see that quite a few things are marked infected.
I had my dedicated server provider install a fresh copy of lucid about 10 hours ago as I said. It appeared to be all patched up; I  upgraded the moment I logged in to the server (I left after I ordered the fresh install and came back about 3 hours later) and all I remember seeing install were language packs.

Since then i have been working to restore databases etc.
The only downloads that I have done are all from seemingly uncompromised sources (I installed the boost c++ libraries and a whole bunch of different libraries through aptitude)
I have apache2, ebox, and phpmyadmin all on and exposed to the world. (Oh and exim4 is installed as a dependency to rkhunter)
My question is, should I brush this off as a false positive?


Also, just to be sure I hadn't somehow mysteriously added a sketchy repository as the cause I checked my sources.list file which is listed below:

Hoping that I am just worrying over something I misunderstand and not facing a legitimate issue here!
Just want to make sure there is nothing to worry about before I spend the next few days uploading mysql database backups.
Thanks for the help :)

O, I feel stupid...
Found it!
