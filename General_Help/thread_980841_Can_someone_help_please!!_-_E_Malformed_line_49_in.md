Hi guys
I am a very newbie and recently decided to convert myself to linux with ubuntu, have 8.10 installed.
I think i did something wrong in Terminal and very random messages were coming up, now i cannot use the package manager, terminal or the update manager.
The error message comes up as 

E: Malformed line 49 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist)
E: The list of sources could not be read.

and the source list shows

Open the file from a terminal or alt-F2 and

```

gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

```

Comment out the last line (the one that reads "deb ...")

Comment out a line by putting # at the start, in this case:

#deb ...

Tell me if that works.
