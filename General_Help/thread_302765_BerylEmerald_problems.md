I just installed Beryl on Edgy.When I open the terminal all I get is a white box,I have to change back to metacity to do any commands, also none of the emerald themes are working.

I used the Howto Beryl with nvidia on edgy guide, anyone any ideas what I done wrong? I managed it with no problem on Dapper ](*,)

try with this xorg.conf  [http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32741/](http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32741/) and remember to backup your own first!

### Post by spinflick on 2006-11-19
Thanks Ragnar, but do you mean replace my old one with a new one or edit it all? and how do I do this?

---

### Post by ragnar_123 on 2006-11-19
first backup your old xorg.conf file ```
sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old
```

then write the new one ```
gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
``` and then paste following:
