Hi!

Just got some weird problem, when i tried to log in as a normal user (to kde) i type the username, then the correct password - kde starts loading, and then shows back the logging screen.

Tried to run from console, when trying to 'startx' as a root kde starts, but while loging into as a normal user got the following error on console.

```
