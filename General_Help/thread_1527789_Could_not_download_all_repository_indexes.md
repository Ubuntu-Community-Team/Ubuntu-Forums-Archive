Hi guys, I noticed a red triangle at the top right of my screen today and I've been trying to sort out the problem. is says "update information is outdated" I used the update like it suggested but get this error msg.. How do I fix this? i'm new to ubuntu/linux so explain in simple terms :)

Thanks for your time..

> Could not download all repository indexes

The repository may no longer be available or could not be contacted because of network problems. If available an older version of the failed index will be used. Otherwise the repository will be ignored. Check your network connection and ensure the repository address in the preferences is correct.

Failed to fetch [http://ppa.launchpad.net/umbuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz](http://ppa.launchpad.net/umbuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz)  404  Not Found
Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

You have a spelling error. It should be :

```
http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz
```

Open you terminal and find that line:

```
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Then save and close.

Hi, thanks for reply

I cant seem to find the line, I did remove WINE using the UBC thinking if I removed it that would solve the problem but it was still there.. here is the contents of the file you asked me to open.

It will be in /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory.

Open a terminal and ```
ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list.d
``` and there should be a file that looks like ubuntu-wine.list.It will be in there.

Either edit the file and correct the spelling or delete the file.You will need to use gksudo to edit or sudo to delete,or open Software Sources and un-tick that repository.

Good Luck
