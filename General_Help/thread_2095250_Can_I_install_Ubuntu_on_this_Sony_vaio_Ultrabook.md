Sony vaio t series for 699

Thinking of getting this laptop, it has no DVD drive so can I install with a USB develop and the live disc?

How well will Ubuntu run on this? Is Sony vaio generally good with Ubuntu? Is there any hardware restrIction that will cause problems?

Thanks

Several users have installed in Sony Vaio.  Not sure about your specific model.

Issues include secure boot with Windows 8, Intel video & Intel SRT. Users have worked around all of these on various systems, but some seem to have issues with Sony. May be settings in UEFI/BIOS.

       Systems need quick boot or fast boot turned off in UEFI settings.

> Disable the RAID, for me it was using the Intel rapid management thingy and telling it to disable the acceleration or the use of the SSD. If you have a different system, just disable the RAID system then install Ubuntu. Once installed you can then re-enable it. 
> You will need to use the dmraid command prior to running the Ubuntu Installer so that it will be able to see the partitions on the drive because otherwise with the raid metadata in place it will see the drive as part of a raid set and ignore its partitions.
