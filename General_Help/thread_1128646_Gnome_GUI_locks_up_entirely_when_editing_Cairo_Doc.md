title: "Gnome GUI locks up entirely when editing Cairo Dock options, etc."

Well, I switched to the Jaunty RC (doing a fresh install). I was getting sick of Intrepid freezing on me for random things and the problem seemed to be solved with Jaunty. Now the only thing that causes any freezes is when I try to edit my Cairo-Dock. On earlier installs I'd get freezes from other weird things (using an incompatible theme, trying to delete stuff in the trash by highliting a group of stuff and pressing "delete") 

If it's any clue, the lockups are PURELY graphical. Most of the time I can move the mouse, and once it locked up when I was burning a disc. However when my disc drive stopped moments later, I found my disc successfully burned. (As in I hard reset and put it in, and found out it had burned perfectly and was totally usable.) From this I assume the system is still functioning, despite the gui freezing up entirely.

Here's the output from the lspci command.

Please help me. I love Ubuntu but it's been so cruel to me.
