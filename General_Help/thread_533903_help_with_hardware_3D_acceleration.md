Hello guys. I am helping a guy to setup his ubuntu system. Ubuntu is alread isntaleld and now I told him to install tremulous, which is a game I recommend (real fun!) After the install, tremulous wasn't in the Applications/Game. that was weird. I told him to restart X by Ctrl + backspace. He did.  It still not in the menu. 

So I told him to execute in the terminal which he gets the following:

```

```


So, I gues he needs to isntall some drivers. O r modify something to enable OpenGL o 3D acceleration. I don't what to do. I been googleing without success.

Here is his lspci output:

```

Yes I did search for 3D acceleration. I am helping a friend here, he has a video card from VIA technologies. I've never heard of it until now.

BUt, so far everything seems so dark...

Thank you folks for your help :)

The Via Unichrome driver has poor 3d support.  It is fine for 2d desktop use, but for games it is just about useless.  IMO, you friend should upgrade to a stand alone Nvidia card.
