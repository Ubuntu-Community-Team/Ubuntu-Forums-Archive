Hello all,
                I have a Targus bluetooth mouse and a Nokia bluetooth headset. I would like to know the appropriate changes to hcid.conf and bluetooth files , so that my mouse connects automatically on restart and at the same time I should be able to connect to the bluetooth headset (when I need to ) for my skype conversations. 

I am not sure that this is possible but I would like try.

I have given the contents of my hcid.conf file below,
> 
#
# HCI daemon configuration file.
#

# HCId options
options {
	# Automatically initialize new devices
	autoinit yes;

	# Security Manager mode
	#   none - Security manager disabled
	#   auto - Use local PIN for incoming connections
	#   user - Always ask user for a PIN
	#
	security user;

	# Pairing mode
	#   none  - Pairing disabled
	#   multi - Allow pairing with already paired devices
	#   once  - Pair once and deny successive attempts
	pairing multi;

        # PIN helper
	pin_helper /usr/bin/bluez-pin;

	# D-Bus PIN helper
	dbus_pin_helper;
	
	# Default PIN code for incoming connections
	passkey "0000";
}

# Default settings for HCI devices
device {
	# Local device name
	#   %d - device id
	#   %h - host name
	name "%h-%d";

	# Local device class
	class 0x3e0100;

	# Default packet type
	#pkt_type DH1,DM1,HV1;

	# Inquiry and Page scan
	iscan enable; pscan enable;
	discovto 0;

	# Default link mode
	#   none   - no specific policy 
	#   accept - always accept incoming connections
	#   master - become master on incoming connections,
	#            deny role switch on outgoing connections
	lm accept;

	# Default link policy
	#   none    - no specific policy
	#   rswitch - allow role switch
	#   hold    - allow hold mode
	#   sniff   - allow sniff mode
	#   park    - allow park mode
	lp rswitch,hold,sniff,park;
}

device 00:12:A1:61:54:94 {
     name "Targus BT Laser Notebook Mouse";
 }

This is the content of my bluetooth file
> # Defaults for bluez-utils

# This file supersedes /etc/default/bluez-pan.  If
# that exists on your system, you should use this
# file instead and remove the old one.  Until you
# do so, the contents of this file will be ignored.

# start bluetooth on boot?
# compatibility note: If this variable is not found bluetooth will
# start
BLUETOOTH_ENABLED=1

############ HIDD
#
# To have Bluetooth mouse and keyboard support, get the
# Linux 2.6.6 patch or better from bluez.org, and set 
# HIDD_ENABLED to 1.
HIDD_ENABLED=1
HIDD_OPTIONS="--server --search"
HIDD_OPTIONS="--connect 00:12:A1:61:54:94 --server"
# to make hidd always use a particular interface, use something
# like this, substituting the bdaddr of the interface:
# HIDD_OPTIONS="-i AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --server"
#
# remove '--master' if you're having trouble working with Ericsson
# T630 phones with hidd operational at the same time.

############ COMPATIBILITY WITH OLD BLUEZ-PAN
# Compatibility: if old PAN config exists, use it
# rather than this file.
if test -f /etc/default/bluez-pan; then
    . /etc/default/bluez-pan

############ DUND

DUND_ENABLED=0

# Arguments to dund: defaults to acting as a server
DUND_OPTIONS="--listen --persist"

# Run dund --help to see the full array of options.
# Here are some examples:
#
# Connect to any nearby host offering access
# DUND_OPTIONS="--search"
#
# Connect to host 00:11:22:33:44:55
# DUND_OPTIONS="--connect 00:11:22:33:44:55"
#
# Listen on channel 3
# DUND_OPTIONS="--listen --channel 3"

# Special consideration is needed for certain devices. Microsoft
# users see the --msdun option.  Ericsson P800 users will need to
# listen on channel 3 and also run 'sdptool add --channel=3 SP'

############ PANDHelp making bluetooth mouse and headset work at the same time!!

#
# Connect to any nearby network controller (access point or ad-hoc)
# PAND_OPTIONS="--role PANU --search"

############ SDPTOOL
# this variable controls the options passed to sdptool on boot, useful if you
# need to setup sdpd on boot.
# options are ;-separated, i.e. for every ; an sdptool instance will be
# launched
#
# examples:
# SDPTOOL_OPTIONS="add --channel=3 SP" # ericsson P800 serial profile
# SDPTOOL_OPTIONS="add --channel=8 OPUSH ; add --channel=9 FTRN" # motorola
#                                             # object push and file transfer
SDPTOOL_OPTIONS=""

If anyone can tell me the exact settings to change for me to access both my mouse (automatically) and my headset (on demand basis), I would greatly appreciate it. I normally use gbtsco for connecting my headset, if anyone has any other better way to access my headset please enlighten me.

With the above hcid.conf and bluetooth file I am able to connect my bluetooth mouse. But it does not reconnect on restart and I am unable to get my bluetooth headset working.  

Any help help is appreciated.

Thankyou.
