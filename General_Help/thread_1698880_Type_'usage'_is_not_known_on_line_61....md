Hi guys, I'm new to Ubuntu and have been trying to set things up for my computer but came across an error:

```
E: Type 'usage:' is not known on line 61 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list
E: The list of sources could not be read.
Go to the repository dialog to correct the problem.
E: _cache->open() failed, please report.
```

I learned to navigate to the sources list but since it seems that the problem is unique to each person computer, I'll put my gedit sources.list up:

```

I hope you can help me figure out what is wrong~
All I know is there's probably something I need to delete or fix in the sources list, but I just don't know what :(

Thanks!

Edit the file with ```
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
``` and remove ```
usage: sudo -h | -K | -k | -L | -V
usage: sudo -v [-AknS] [-p prompt]
usage: sudo -l[l] [-AknS] [-g groupname|#gid] [-p prompt] [-U username] [-u
            username|#uid] [-g groupname|#gid] [command]
usage: sudo [-AbEHknPS] [-C fd] [-g groupname|#gid] [-p prompt] [-u
            username|#uid] [-g groupname|#gid] [VAR=value] [-i|-s] [<command>]
usage: sudo -e [-AknS] [-C fd] [-g groupname|#gid] [-p prompt] [-u
            username|#uid] file ...
```

which is not supposed to be there.

That looks like terminal output for man sudo.

Good Luck
