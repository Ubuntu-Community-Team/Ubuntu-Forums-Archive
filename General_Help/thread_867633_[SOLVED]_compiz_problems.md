I recently upgraded to hardy.
Till a couple of days ago all was fine.
But then something has gone wrong. I have a feeling it was compiz.
Now I have uninstalled it compeletely and all is well.
The problem was that I had kept burn as my open and close animation. And dodge was my focus animation.
Whenever I tried to open or close a window or change one the speed of my computer (Intel Core 2, 1GB RAM, 1.73 GHz) would suddenly dip so low that it reminded me of Windows infected with several viruses.
But now I miss those effects.
Oh, by the way just before this started I had installed emerald (uninstalled that too now).
Please suggest me something.

Please don't bump your threads every 18 minutes.  It actually makes it less likely that someone that can help you will see the thread.  See: [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=82471](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=82471)

What video card is it you are using and what driver? What does your /etc/X11/xorg.conf look like? What is the output of glxinfo?

Ok, I have no experience with this particular card, but this link:
[http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=2320]("http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=2320") implies that although it is possible to get the card running, forget the burn/explode/transparency, as the GPU cannot cope. So your CPU steps in to handle the work via software, and you feel like you are back in Redmond.
If it is not a laptop you may be able to add a good nVidia card to get flashy effects.

Reinstall compiz.

Things generally don't just break by themselves. What did you install and/or change from the time you had it working until the time it stopped working correctly for you?

Would you please post the output of the following also:

```

lspci

```

Thank you.

And my opening post mentions exactly what I had installed when this started.

### Post by sameer.india on 2008-07-23
Oh!
By the way tried installing additional plugins from git but it didn't happen anyway
