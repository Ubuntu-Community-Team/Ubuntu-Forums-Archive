Does anyone know where you can get a driver for an internal web cam 
(Laptop Dv6000) i tried using cheese but when i run cheese the program says that there is no webcam available. im guessing this is a driver issue. Can anyone help me with this?

Try using Ekiga see if the cam works/detected. You may have to work with the settings > Open Ekiga > Edit > Preferences > Devices > Video Devices > try changing some of the settings. (try both V4L and V4L2)

To test your webcam you can do this. There are 6 icons on the left side of the main Ekiga window. Push the 4th button from the top (a grey round webcam). If eveything is ok, you'll see the output of the webcam. If not, you'll see the Ekiga logo bouncing slowly.

If Ekiga doesn't work post results of these commands:
```

lspci
```
