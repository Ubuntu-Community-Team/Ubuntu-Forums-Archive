Odds are even with an up to date driver it will still be unable to support compiz, built in graphics drivers tend not to be very good.

Huh, if you can find your graphics card infromation then that would be helpfull then.

```
lspci
```should spew infromation on devices available, I'm sure your graphics card should be listed there, could you post the output between [noparse]```
 and 
```[/noparse] tags?

OK, so it's an intel chipset 82945G/GZ graphics card, it does support XGL, but not direct rendering, which is the problem. If you install **compiz-settings-manager** you might be able to turn on some of the options, but I don't think you'll be able to turn on all that much at once.

Sorry I can't be of much help, but the drivers available just don't support it.

Well, Is my situation roughly the same then?  I am using a toshiba laptop with an integrated intel graphics card (the card itself having 128 megabytes)  I put the command in terminal and this is what I got.

When I use compiz checker it tells me that compiz can't work with vesa driver.

The exact question I have here is how do I get an intel driver for my graphics card in ubuntu 8.10 (by the company Gos)?  Will compiz work with the intel driver?

Thank you for any help.

Well one thing that I did that might have helped (probably is at least a good start).  Is I opened Terminal and put in

sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Then terminal opened this list of all the drivers.  Careful not to touch anything accept for...

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Configured Video Device"
EndSection

Then I just put Driver "intel" right after the Identifier and clicked save at the top.  Then it looked like this.

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Configured Video Device"
	Driver 		"intel"
EndSection

What I did here seemed to turn my vesa driver off and some intel driver on.  Either way that made the compiz checker tell me that I can use compiz.  However compiz still doesnt upload in the gui.  I think I got compiz to work through terminal. I downloaded compiz somehow.  I first tried just typing in compiz into the terminal and terminal told me to type something else in to download it.  I am sorry I forgot exactly what it was but it was something like...

sudo apt-get download compiz

Then I just typed in compiz to turn it on.  It came up with a few errors but I think it is still turned on because when I go to prefrences/ appearance/prefrences and click on the visual effects tab on the window that pops up, I click on "Normal" and instead of telling me that compiz cannot be found (like it used to before all this) an error message comes up telling me "desktop effects could not be enabled".

So in the end I beleive I accomplished a peice of the puzzle, but then again I only have a vauge idea that I somehow got compiz to partially work, and then I defaulted some kind of intel driver for my driver card.

by the way compiz checker can be found on the following site.  The instructions seem easy and safe enough to me.

[http://forlong.blogage.de/entries/pages/Compiz-Check](http://forlong.blogage.de/entries/pages/Compiz-Check)

It helped eliminate some minor problems of its own.

Compiz won't work until you fix your libGL/AIGLX issues.

If Compiz was working 3 days ago, and it doesn't work now, what have you done in the last 3 days? Did you install any updates (especailly kernel or video driver) or new software?

i din't install anything, but i keep updating which shows by update manager and yes my kernal has been updated on same day.
So what i need to recover, i have kept visual effects none,
so now ubuntu speed is correct.
whenever i try changing visual effects to normal/custom, all my applications and desktop become slow, like it just drags, woobly kinda thing:(

If you want to try reinstalling the video driver:
```
sudo apt-get purge xorg-driver-fglrx
sudo apt-get --reinstall install libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-glx mesa-utils
```

I suggested "purge xorg-driver-fglrx" because another intel video user had the exact same symptoms as yours and reported that he had fglrx (ATI proprietary video driver) installed, interfering with libGL.

If you reinstall the video driver, restart the system, and still experience the following output of LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo :
```
libGL: OpenDriver: trying /usr/lib/dri/i915_dri.so
[B]libGL error: dlopen /usr/lib/dri/i915_dri.so failed (/usr/lib/dri/i915_dri.so: undefined symbol: _glapi_Dispatch)
libGL error: unable to load driver: i915_dri.so
...
Segmentation fault[/B]
```
then please add to this Launchpad bug report: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mesa-utils/+bug/244734](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mesa-utils/+bug/244734)

hey thanks you so much temujin for your time and help with my problem:)
now after installing new drivers, my ubuntu is giving same as previous week's performance, i'm very happy today, my desktop just recovered from  sloth, all credits goes to you:)

ok fine what should i report to launchpad bug? I haven't done this before.

why i'm not able to mark this thread as solved? Is this case same to you also?

---

### Post by Yellow Pasque on 2009-03-12
The "SOLVED" feature was causing database issues, so it is no longer used on these forums.

You don't need to post anything to Launchpad since your issue was resolved by reinstalling the video driver.

You're welcome. Enjoy!
