I have Edgy on a AMD64 Compaq v2000 running 64bit Edgy.  My 6 in 1 card reader doesn't work.  It worked in (i386) Dapper, but only about 50% of the time, which was fine for most purposes, although a little bit annoying.  With the upgrade to (AMD64) Edgy, the dumb thing has stopped working.  Anyone have any suggestions?

dmesg doesn't register anything when I put a card in.

OK, I got it working.  See [http://www.webcon.ca/%7Eimorgan/tifm21/](http://www.webcon.ca/%7Eimorgan/tifm21/) this page if you need to make it work too.  Just remember it only works for SD cards, but this may be changed sometime in the future, so the page is worth looking at anyway.
