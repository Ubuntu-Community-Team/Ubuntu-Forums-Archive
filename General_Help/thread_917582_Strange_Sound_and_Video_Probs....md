I'm currently running 8.04 on a sony vio vgn-n350n with compiz/emerald (versions that come with 8.04) and a couple screenlets, clearwheather and watermarks, neways...

movie player is my default and every time i try to open movies regargless of formats, the video saverly lags and theres no sound unless i hit sound up in the options, and somtimes that doesn't work
if i open in another player video works fine and no sound
if i reboot the first time i open movie player it will play just fine (long as i hit the "sound up" option, but after closing it, reopening untill another reboot, or relog, the original problem happens....
