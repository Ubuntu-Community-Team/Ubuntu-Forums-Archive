Hi,

I installed Ubuntu Gnome a few days ago alongside Windows on my laptop and worked flawlessly. However, this morning after booting up Windows 8, it notified me that there was a "drive error" and had to restart. After that windows would not boot up at all and wanted to go on recovery mode. My question is, would backing up my data from a secure external hard drive affect Ubuntu in any way? I dont know the effects of recovery mode of Windows on the partition done on the hard drive, any help would be appreciated. And also, is backing up the whole windows image from a hard drive the best way to solve this issue?

Thanks

Having a full backup of Windows is always a good idea.

And having a repair flash drive, so you can run repairs if Windows does not boot.

Did you leave secure boot or fast boot (always on hibernation) on? And the did you boot Windows thru grub menu or directly from UEFI boot options? Grub will not boot hibernated Windows.
