I shelved my linux partition for a while because of endless problems trying to install downloaded software, but I've now summoned up the energy/courage to try again.  I hope you guys can help me!

I'm not sure where to start, but what seems to be the most fundamental problem that needs fixing is that I cannot connect to the Ubuntu repositories using apt-get or synaptic package manager.  

The error I get from sudo apt-get update is:

W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems
E: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

I found a forum post involving a similar problem, but no solution was found.  I also posted the problem a few weeks back at which time it was suggested I change from za.archive to us.archive.  This gave the same error.  I can  ping both addresses with no errors.

Any ideas?

Can you ping them by name?  If not, it sounds like you have dns problems.  Check your /etc/resolv.conf  (you are also having internet connectivity problems too?)

If you can ping them by name, try visiting the links with your browser.  You should be able to navigate the directory (but you won't see any package names, they are tucked inside zipped files)

I can ping by name and browse the directories.  No other connectivity problems.

Aha!  It seems that I needed to set the http proxy.

Things are looking more promising....
