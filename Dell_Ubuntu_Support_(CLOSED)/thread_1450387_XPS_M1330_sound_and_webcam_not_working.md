Using debootstrap/chroot I've made an installation of Xubuntu to a new hard disk from my XPS M1330 already running Ubuntu Karmic, most things work fine except webcam and sound.

I have volume controls but no sound for any application. I've run gstreamer-properties and could get sound when testing for the OSS option, pulseaudio didn't work. Do you have any idea of what should I install/edit in order to get sound working?

Is it possible to check what drivers my Ubuntu system has so that I could search and install them for Xubuntu?

Thanks in advance for your help.
