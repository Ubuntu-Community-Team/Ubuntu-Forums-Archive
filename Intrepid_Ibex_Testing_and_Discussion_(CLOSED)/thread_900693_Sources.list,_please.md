Hello.

I installed Kubuntu Intrepid yesterday from the daily iso and while I got it working fine now, the sources.list was created empty (except from the CD). I edited the file manually and added the most important repositories to get Intrepid up and running.

Now I would like to turn my sources.list into the vanilla state. Could anyone please post the content of an original, vanilla Intrepid sources.list?

Thanks in advance.

I can't, but it is pretty close to:

deb [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) intrepid main restricted universe multiverse

deb [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) intrepid-updates main restricted universe multiverse

deb [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) intrepid-backports main restricted universe multiverse

deb [http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu](http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu) intrepid partner

deb [http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu](http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) intrepid-security main restricted universe multiverse
