Hi,

I have upgraded to 8.10 on my Acer TM7720
When I load Kernel 2.6.24-19 my WAN connects and works really well.
If I load any newer kernel (2.6.26-x) my WAN shows as connected on the status bar but I have no access to network or internet.
Were the wireless drivers changed for some reason in kernel 2.6.27??

I think I have found the problem why WAN in kernel 2.6.27-x doesn't work.
Kernel 2.6.27-xx uses driver iwlagn
Kernel 2.6.24-19 uses driver iwl4965.

My question is how to I get driver iwl4965 into kernel 2.6.27-6
Can anyone help me
