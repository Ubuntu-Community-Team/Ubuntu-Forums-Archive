I am running edgy and am trying to play a game that is unusable without DRI enabled. I have a ATI Radeon Mobility 9700 video card. How do I enable DRI?

Nevermind, I got it working following your link, thank you for the help. I misread the first time, I needed to add a section at the end of xorg.conf to turn off the composite.
