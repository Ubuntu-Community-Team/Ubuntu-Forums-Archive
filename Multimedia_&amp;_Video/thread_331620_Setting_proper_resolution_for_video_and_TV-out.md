title: "Setting proper resolution for video and TV-out"

### Post by josef_renklint on 2007-01-04
I've finally gotten video to work on my TV using TV-out on my ati radeon x700. I'm using VLC media player (vlc -V x11) and ubuntu edgy.

The issue at hand is this: Where do I change resolution for the TV so that the TV resolutions matches the video size? I've looked around in various forums and all I see is people posting their xorg.conf and asking for solutions, so I will do likewise. Please, if you have a solution for me, read through my settings and give me a push in the right direction!

xorg.conf:

What/where am I supposed to make changes?

Kind regards, Josef
