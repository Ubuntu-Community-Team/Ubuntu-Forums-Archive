### Post by usernamebob on 2007-01-01
Hey, I tried a bunch of guides and none of them worked for me.. after some work I managed to get them going.. I thought I'd write a guide to help other people with the same issues I had. On alot of systems you can install in alot less steps than this.. but this is the most failsafe method I know. This is my first Howto, so feel free to give me some feedback!

Firstly, if you already have fglrx drivers of an earlier version installed you'll need to get rid of them.. if your doing this without an older version of the fglrx drivers installed skip ahead

```
sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
```

find the line in the file that says 

```
	Driver      "fglrx"
```

and change it to

```
	Driver      "ati"
```

now remove the drivers file reboot

```
sudo apt-get remove xorg-driver-fglrx
shutdown -r now

```

**(if you didn't need to remove an old version of the fglrxdrivers start here)**

we'll need to disable aiglx

```
sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
```

If it's not already there add this to the end of the file

```
Section "Extensions"
	Option	    "Composite" "Disable"
EndSection
```

now install all the needed deb's

```

apt-get update
apt-get install module-assistant build-essential wget
apt-get install fakeroot dh-make debconf libstdc++5 linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

blacklist the fglrx kernel modules included in the linux restricted modules package so it won't conflict
```

sudo gedit /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
```

and add this line 

```
DISABLED_MODULES="fglrx"
```

now download the driver package and set permissons
```
wget -c https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/ati-driver-installer-8.32.5-x86.x86_64.run
chmod +x ati-driver-installer-8.32.5-x86.x86_64.run

```

build the packages, and fix some possible issues
```

chmod +x ati-driver-installer-8.32.5-x86.x86_64.run
./ati-driver-installer-8.32.5-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/edgy
dpkg -i xorg-driver-fglrx_8.32.5-1_i386.deb fglrx-kernel-source_8.32.5-1_i386.deb fglrx-control_8.32.5-1_i386.deb
rm /usr/src/fglrx-kernel*.deb
sudo mkdir -p /usr/src/modules/fglrx/linux
sudo touch /usr/src/modules/fglrx/linux/config.h
```

rebuild the kernel module

```
module-assistant prepare
module-assistant update
module-assistant build fglrx
module-assistant install fglrx
depmod -a
```

now enable the drivers using the ati tool

```
aticonfig --initial
aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv
```

Reboot and you should be running with the new drivers

```
sudo shutdown -r now
```

However, I had to also delete an extra **Driver** section in *xorg.conf*.  The **aticonfig** commands added a ***new*** driver section, instead of *replacing* the old section. :/

Once I erased the incorrect **Driver** section, it worked, though. :)  Thanks muchly! ^_^

!! This reply was sent to a wrong thread. Proper thread is [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=328751]("http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=328751")
It's not necessary to disable the boot splash. Try following:

Install hwinfo with synaptic and then type in a termial

```
sudo hwinfo -- framebuffer

```
You'll get a list of supported values. Write down one of the values with 32bit extension. Open the menu.lst
```
sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst 
```
and search for 
#defoptions=quiet splash

Add to this line vga=value where value is to replace with the value which you have write down (0x0366 for example). **!!Please do not remove the "#" before defoption!!**
Save the file and close it.

Update grub
```
sudo update-grub 
```
and then reboot.

This will solve the issue. Alternative you can add vga=792 in the defoptions=....-line. 
Note: The value which you have insert in menu.lst will change the resolution of the splash screen and the VT. For me worked 0x0366, this give a resolution of 1600x1050 for both VT and splashscreen on an ATI X1400. It may possible that the splash screen is not centered on the screen or the aspect ratio get wrong. 
A possible solution is to type in a terminal:

```
sudo update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`
```

Any noticeable improvements over the stock 8.28 drivers?

---

### Post by blu3sman on 2007-01-04
hi Bob just a coupla questions before i try this (tried nearly everything else with no luck so may as well give this a go).
What Video card are you using? (ATI Radeon X1900XTX here)
Are you using Edgy and if so is it 32bit or 64 bit? (64bit Edgy here).
Thanks.

### Post by jimbo2150 on 2007-01-04
WOW! Fix city!

I finally realized that my 8.28 (installed through synaptic) had video problems. Xv did not work at all! No wonder videos were so choppy, slow, and gstreamer did not work at all with most videos.

After following this guide today and installing the latest ATI drivers my Xv overlay now works great and I can finally use gstreamer with pretty much any vid now (where it failed with the typical "subclass did not specify size" error)!

Must say I am impressed with the 8.32.5 driver.
Next step composite?

Note: I have not tried beryl with this version and unfortunately don't intend to. Will wait for Feisty release to do that because I crashed big time a couple of months ago trying with Edgy.

I got this too! Had me scratching my head for a while. Strange how previous (pre AMD buyout :rolleyes:  ) updates didn't do this.

Thanks to OP for the HOWTO.

Hi Guys,
As I see you used [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI) guide. I used it too. And however X.org.log looks fine, " LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose fglrxinfo"  results in 
```
andrew@andrew-laptop:~$ LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose fglrxinfo

```

Why does Xorg look into /usr/X11R6/.... but does not looks into /usr/lib/xorg/modules???

regadrs,
A.

excellent how-to.  thanks.  never woulda figured it out on my own.

typo here: 

dpkg -i xorg-driver-fglrx_8.32.5-1_i386.deb fglrx-kernel-source_8.32.5-1_i386.deb fglrx-control_8.32.5-1_i386.deb

should be for x64.

---

### Post by IanW on 2007-01-06
Only if you're installing on a 64-bit Ubuntu. The ATI package generates either 32 or 64-bit files as required.

ie. on a 32-bit system it will give you files named *_i386.deb and on 64-bit they will be called *_x64.deb

### Post by sorry_name_taken_already2 on 2007-01-08
Still a Noob here since 2005!
I followed and edited xorg.conf as instructed but cant load up GDM or xserver. I was wondering is there an alternative? How do you install XGl and is it final realease yet? I spent 3 nights searching in Forums and reading many similar HOW TOs! I am tired of re-installing Edgy, sucks! I am trying to install UBUNTU on a IBM T42, Radeon 9500, max resolution 1024 x 768.

Can someone supply with a valid xorg.conf. 
It seems the xorg.conf generated from install was buggy too.. It was missing 
(WW) The directory "/usr/share/X11/fonts/misc" does not exist.
I opened a can of more whoops *** after installing Ati fglrx 8.32.5 drivers

Someone out there kind enough to sieve thru my log file?

**Here is my Here is my Xorg.log and xorg.conf **
Please email me asap [email]curious_@hotmail.com[/email]

I just wanted to thank you.  I have been trying to fix my display for days now and this is a thread that "worked out of the box"

Hey, thanks for the great guide.  It was going well untill I got down to this:

rebuild the kernel module

```
module-assistant prepare
module-assistant update
module-assistant build fglrx
module-assistant install fglrx
depmod -a
```

My ubuntu dosen't recognize these commands. 

How do I make linux recognize the commands please?
