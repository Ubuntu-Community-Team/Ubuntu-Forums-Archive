Hi,

I'm trying to increase my screen resolution from the existing maximum resolution of 1024x768 to 1280x1024. 

I'm using Dapper Drake 6.06 and my video card is GeForce 5200. From searching the support forums I have already tried:

- Running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" - seems like my card is detected without problems.

- Editing the xorg.conf file, adding the desired resolution in each mode.

None of them worked. Still get 1024x768 as the maximum one.

My xorg.conf is here:

```

Any idea what else I can do? I'm completely new (installed for the first time a few days ago).
Thanks!

Try to change the Driver entry under the "Device" section from "nv" to "nvidia". This might help or not...
