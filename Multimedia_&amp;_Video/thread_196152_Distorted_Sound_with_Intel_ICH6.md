### Post by mary on 2006-06-13
There are sound problems on my mother's computer, which, good daughter that I am, I am trying to fix (remotely, so I can't actually hear if it works):  She just upgraded to Dapper, and has an integrated Intel ICH6 sound card.  After fiddling about a bit to get the sound working at all, it is apparently fuzzy, and only coming out of one speaker.  

I told her to play around with alsamixer to try to fix it, but it's not working.  I think that nothing big is messed up; from what I've looked at,everything seems fine:
```

mary@Bob:/$ lspci | grep audio
0000:00:1e.2 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 03)
mary@Bob:/$ cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [ICH6           ]: ICH4 - Intel ICH6
                     Intel ICH6 with AD1980 at 0xdffffa00, irq 58
mary@Bob:/$ lsmod | grep intel8x0

snd                    55268  14 snd_intel8x0m,snd_opl3_lib,snd_hwdep,snd_cs4236_lib,snd_mpu401_uart,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq_device,snd_cs4231_lib,snd_intel8x0,snd_ac97_codec,snd_pcm_oss,snd_mixer_oss,snd_pcm,snd_timer
snd_page_alloc         10632  4 snd_intel8x0m,snd_cs4231_lib,snd_intel8x0,snd_pcm

```

My guess is that there is something to be set appropriately in alsamixer, or something. However, since I'm not actually there listening to her speakers, I can't really judge what helps the sound, and don't know anything about either Ubuntu or sound in general.  

Could someone with this card working either give me their output of amixer, so I can try to copy it, or does anyone know what else could be causing crappy sound with this card and Dapper?  Is there any other information I could give that would be helpful?

Thanks,
Mary

my mother's amixer output is:
