Hi,

I can't see any Video files while using an external screen on my laptop (Dell Inspiron 8600, ATI Radeon 9600) whatever software I use (vlc, totem....). I can see everything (desktop, windows, menu...) exept the content of the video that stays black but it works perfectly on the laptop screen. 
Everything else works perfectly with the external screen included fullscreen games !  I use Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy.

I looked on the web (and this forum) and try to edit my xorg.conf but nothing works. I don't know anything about this file and I just tried to copy/paste solutions I've seen on the web. There it's my xorg.conf file:

Something that may be useful: When I go to: System->Preferences->Multimedia System Selector to test the video output, only one config doesn't output a black window: X Window System (No Xv), but it only works on the test even after a reboot :( 

If someone got any idea, thanks to help me ! I've looked a while and nothing works. I'd like to watch some videos on my screen !

Thank you.

I'm not sure how to do it in totem, but if you install vlc, you can probably get the result you want (see the movie both on laptop and external monitor screen) by editing preferences, choosing to view advanced options (it's a radio button in the lower right of the preferences screen), going to video, output modules, and choosing "X11 Video Output".  Worked for me.  Now if only I can find how to do that in totem...
