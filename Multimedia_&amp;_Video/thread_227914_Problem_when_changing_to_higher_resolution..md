I'm having a problem with my computer at work. By default the highest my resolution would go was 1024x768 until I edited xorg.conf and added 1280x1024. I can now change to 1280x1024 but my desktop shrinks to almost half and I can't figure out how to make it right. See pic...

When I change back to 1024x768 its back to full screen. :confused: 

I ran
```

sudo ddcprobe | grep monitorrange

```
and entered the refresh rates in xorg.conf still no go.

Here is my current xorg.conf
```

have you tried changing the resolution by running:
```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
```?
