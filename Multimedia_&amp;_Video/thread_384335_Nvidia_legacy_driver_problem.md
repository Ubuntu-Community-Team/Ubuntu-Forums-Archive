My computer can not download

NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-7184-pkg1.run from the website for some reason. The problem I have it that I have the Nvidia leagacy debian packages that install and all the other ones that go with it including the linux image package. I thought that this would give me direct rendering for beryl so that it does not crash on me. So when I typed in

root@ubuntu:/home/masterj# glxinfo | grep direct

I said```
root@ubuntu:/home/masterj# glxinfo | grep direct
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
```

I dont know what to do.

I think it is beacuse I never installed a NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-7184-pkg1.run on my ubuntu. could some help me figure this out and can some give me a link or download to NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-7184-pkg1.run please? Thanks in advance:)

What type of card do you have?

You probably want the 96XX package.

I have a nvidia riva tnt2/tnt2 pro (This is in the lists for the legacy)

I found the problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have had the problem of trying to get this to work and I finaly did!!!!

I had everything installed but I forgot to type nvidia-xconfig in the root terminal alone.

Thanks a lot though:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)

I have the exact same problem with the same graphics card. When I type:
nvidia-xconfig

It executes the command successfully by writing this:
```


Using X configuration file: "/etc/X11/xorg.conf".
Backed up file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' as '/etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'
New X configuration file written to '/etc/X11/xorg.conf'


```

But when I log back in I still get the same output from glxinfo | grep:
```

What should I do?

I fingured out the problem some days ago. The problem is that you have to load the dri and glcore. The way you do this is by typing in # before the word load in your xorg. Make sure that you type in the glx load also. That does not have to have #.

:)

### Post by Quibly on 2007-03-21
I dont understand you to well. Cant you post the complete xorg file that you are currently using?
Thanks!

Ok, I am still having this problem. When I changed my xorg.conf to yours, everything worked fine, except the resolution was very big, and there were a couple of other minor problems. So I reconfigured my xorg.conf and only copied the modules section of you xorg to mine. Now my graphics card doesnt work and this is what I get from
glxinfo | grep direct:

You need to have # before the word load on dri and glcore and make sure load glx is their. Copy and pats the last section which is the section called Extensions. you don't need to write ###full section only needed for beryl### and to disable it at first.:) 

try that first then restart your computer and see if that works. If not I take a look at it again.:)
