i installed some nvidia driver a couple of days ago and have rebooted many times since then....i had some updates today with and newer version of the kernel which i installed....

i rebooted and it says that the x server could not be loaded...i typed startx and then it gives this error

FATAL: Module nvidia not found.
(EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module!
(EE) NVIDIA(0):  ***Aborting***
(EE) Screen(s) found, but none have a usale configuration.

i tried modprobe nvidia  and it says Module nvidia not found.

Am seeing a pattern with users of nVidia cards having problems recently.

As advised to other users, I used the howto located [here]("http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Latest_Nvidia_Dapper") and have not had any issues at all with my setup.

Have a look through and try recompling the drivers. You may find that your Xorg configuration has reverted back to nv instead of nvidia

If your kernel has been custom compiled at some stage, this could be a good reason as to why it is not working properly

cheers,

thanks for the link but the part where i make the shortcut can only be done when i've actually gotten into the ubuntu desktop and using the terminal.

but at the moment i cant get into it because the X server doesnt load because of an error because it cant load or there isnt a nvidia kernel module...

thanks...i will be using your link as soon as i get into the desktop

A quick fix (then you will need to read the guide):
```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
```

and select the "nv" driver. Press ENTER whenever you don't know the answer to the questions.

then type:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart (or "kdm restart" if you use KDM)
```

Then you should be able to get to the Desktop Environment.

the quick fix doesnt work..

when i type the restart bit it says stopping and starting the gnome display manager  the scren flashes on and off slowly three times and then it goes back to the screen which says failed to load x server

then when i press ok , it goes back to the command line , and when i type dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg again, it says debconf: DbDriver "config": /var/cache/debconf/config.dat is locked by another process

I'm having the same problem. Came home from work, turned on ubuntu, run update, restart and my Gnome is gone. I'm realy :evil: :evil: :evil: :evil: about solving such problems. I gues I'm going to smoke pipe  for a while because I'm just going mad. Ok, I'll fix machine of mine later, but what I'm sorry about: If user has to deal with such problems, then Dapper isn't really windows alternative for masses... What a shame... (I do not blame anybody, just making my comment.)

Try manually editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf, replace nvidia driver with nv driver and restart. This should be good enough to complete rest of process.

You should have read this (if you installed the Nvidia driver)

Restart your computer:
```
sudo reboot
```

Boot in RECOVERY MODE from the GRUB Menu almost as soon as you turn on your computer (it will take you to the command line).

Then you will need to type:
```
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
```

and select the "vesa" driver. Press ENTER whenever you don't know the answer to a question.

4) Type:
```
reboot
```

The Xserver should work fine

Yes, I definitely should have. I guess I'm typical user: doesn't analyze what is going to be updated and does not read documentation troughly.

i didn't do it your way, i loaded up with a previous kernel version and used the guide to install my video driver within kernel version 2.6.15-25-386. Then i re-booted and typed uname -r and it was 2.6.15-26-386.
so i succesfully booted with the new kernel which included my video driver.

now another problem is that the guide made me create a shortcut in the Applications>System menu....and i still had the original shortcut....

how would i delete one of them?

In a certain sense you did it (as I'm the author of that guide) :p  (I'm kidding)

2 tseliot: First I wanted to mention that I fortunately didn't delete envy_8762_32 script. (Yes, it did the job again.) Now I checked you profile and noticed, that you are actually author of the script!. :) You should have mentioned that right away. No, now I'm joking... Well, thank you, thank you twice. For writing the script and patience with inpatient users.

boot in RECOVERY MODE from the GRUB Menu almost as soon as you turn on your computer (it will take you to the command line).

Then you will need to type:
```
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
```

and select the "nv" driver. Press ENTER whenever you don't know the answer to a question.

Type:
```
reboot
```

tseliot:

Great job writing this.  I tried one of the other ones i think that it was for hoary or something and it killed me.  So broke out the laptop looked it up again and found this one.  Thank you for the walk though.

To all others:

Follow the steps!  where you see gedit if you are at a bash shell try using vi or another shell editor.  you will not have to boot into gdm at all to edit the file that way. then you can do a sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart or what ever.  I did it all from the bash shell and restarted and it worked just fine, when i slowed down and did what it said.  as well make sure you save the NVIDIA-Settings.desktop just like it says.  I did min in low-case and it failed.

I am also receiving the "Failed to Load the Nvidia kernel module" error when I use "nvidia" instead of "nv" in the xorg.conf. I have tried all of the suggestions in this thread to no avail. I have a feeling that it may have something to do with the fact that I just recompiled (not sure if that's the right terminology - i'm new to linux) my kernel to 686. I have an Nvidia Quadro NVS 120 and i have never been able to successfully install the drivers.

Here is my xorg.conf:

1) Which version of Ubuntu are you using?
2) How did you install the driver?
3) Did you read this:
[WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CHANGE YOUR KERNEL OR IF YOUR KERNEL IS UPDATED]("http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Latest_Nvidia_Edgy#WHAT_HAPPENS_IF_YOU_CHANGE_YOUR_KERNEL_OR_IF_YOUR_KERNEL_IS_UPDATED")

Hi there, I'm running Edgy (or not as the case may be) on a GeForce Ti 4200

Like easyease, I used Automatix2 to install nVidia drivers, and then Envy ON TOP of that. (noob mistake - sorry!)

Seems I've made a mistake, as when I ran Envy (and, later, "Method 1" described by tseliot at doc.gwos.org), I get the X server failure screen, saying:

```
Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.17-11-generic/volatile/nvidia.ko'
No such file or directory.
Failed to load the nvidia kernel module
```

At this stage, I'm assuming Automatix2 did something but I don't know what. Before I ran Envy, I used to get (when I typed "glxinfo | grep rendering"):

```
direct rendering: Yes
```

Now I get:
```

Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
```

I know this is a old topic, but I've tried everything I could find on this forum!

Many, many thanks in anticipation of any help you can give.

Adam

I've also got the 'Failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module' problem as well.  I've tried all the methods posted on the links as well as compiling a kernel.  
I'm running Feisty and a GeForce4 Ti 4200.


Any ideas?


Thanks,

I too have this problem, I recently migrating the linux hdd that ubuntu was on to a newer AMD X2 3800 dual core system with a Nvidia GeForce7600 video card, prev video card was a Geforce FX5200. When I booted up the hdd the video did not work even though it was working fine on the last machine, I have tried reinstalling and removing packages and including the linux restricted modules to no avail, I have tried Kano's script which he told me works with Ubuntu as well to now availa and I have tried every suggestion in this forum to no avail.....either I'm missing something or this is a major BUG.

> I too have this problem, I recently migrating the linux hdd that ubuntu was on to a newer AMD X2 3800 dual core system with a Nvidia GeForce7600 video card, prev video card was a Geforce FX5200. When I booted up the hdd the video did not work even though it was working fine on the last machine, I have tried reinstalling and removing packages and including the linux restricted modules to no avail, I have tried Kano's script which he told me works with Ubuntu as well to now availa and I have tried every suggestion in this forum to no avail.....either I'm missing something or this is a major BUG.
Using 3rd party scripts might make a mess. Can you post a link to Kano's script so that I can see how you can uninstall what it installed?

P.S. set the driver to "nvidia" in the Section Device of your xorg.conf, reboot and then post your Xorg.0.log (otherwise I'll see only what the "vesa" driver says in the log)

The same problem. I have Ubuntu Feisty, I had kernel 2.6.20-16-generic, nvidia driver installerd by Restricted drivers manager, 3D acceleration, beryl... Everything worked. Then I updatet this kernel (it si still 2.6.20-16-generic but newest] and now i have this error message. I don`t wanna to change driver to "nv" because I want to use 3d acceleration. I try to reinstall driver, kernel, but without success. On 2.6.20-15-generic kernel the nvidia driver still works

Anytime you update the kernel I believe you have to reinstall the nvidia drivers.

So I'd assume you'd uninstall the restricted driver package. Reboot, configure xserver to use vesa. then reinstall the restricted driver packages. Or if you are using the driver direct from NVidia, then make sure you have your kernel headers for your updated kernel, then reinstall the nvidia driver package. It will uninstall the previous install driver and auto configure xserver.

Everything I've read is you have to "rebuild" your nvidia driver every time you change your kernel.

I had the same problem, and to be honest I was almost going to install Windows and be done with it](*,)

but I found a fix in another forum post <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=373003&page=3">here</a>

bear in mind this only works for AGP systems, but it worked brilliantly for me and I now have my GeForce 6200 up and running quite nicely :-D


Hope this helps

install new driver packages manually,remove old driver.
sudo dpkg -r nvidia-glx
sudo dpkg -i nvidia-glx(or nvidia-glx-new)

> A quick fix (then you will need to read the guide):
```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
```

and select the "nv" driver. Press ENTER whenever you don't know the answer to the questions.

then type:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart (or "kdm restart" if you use KDM)
```

Then you should be able to get to the Desktop Environment.

Thanks tseliot - as the above solution resolved a problem I have had for some time! 

Of interest, I could utilize the 386 kernel with no problems - but Nvidia settings cracked it with the 686 kernel???  Since I am running Ubuntu on a PC that supports 2 x P2 processors, I am now happily running the 686 kernel...
