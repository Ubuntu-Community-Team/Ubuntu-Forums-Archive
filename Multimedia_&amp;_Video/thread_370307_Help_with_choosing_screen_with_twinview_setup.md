Trying to run an app on a screen alone, so it won't stretch over two screens.

from what iv read I'm supposed to use  DISPLAY=":0.1" app but when i do i get an error.

```

Application tried to create a window, but no driver could be loaded.
Make sure that your X server is running and that $DISPLAY is set correctly.

```

So i suppose i have to identify my screens in my xorg.conf? but how? 
Here is my current conf.

```

I'v temorarly solved this via using 
```
Option "MetaModes" "1280x1024,1280x1024; 1024x768,1024x768; 1280x1024,NULL;
```
 
this isn't optimal, but at least its not stretching over both screens.
