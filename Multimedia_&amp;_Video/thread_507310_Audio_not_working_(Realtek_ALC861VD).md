### Post by Commodore Guff on 2007-07-22
Okay, so I just installed Feisty (x64, x86_64, amd64, whichever you prefer) on this system.  The problem is that there's no audio.
It seemed to detect it fine at first, but there was no output.  So I did a little looking around, and followed [this guide.]("http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=506678")
It didn't work.  In fact, now it thinks I have no audio device at all.

Can anyone help?

Can you open a terminal and type 'sudo lshw -class sound' and post the output from that here.
Can you also type in a terminal 'cat /proc/asound/card0/codec\#*' and post the output from that here.
(that command ends with the hash and star symbols in case its not clearly visible on your monitor)

Oh, and just to rule out my own stupidity, yes, the speakers are connected, and the sound works in Windows.

As far as I see there is no alsa support for your card - but oss seems to work!
see:

So, what can I do?

### Post by Commodore Guff on 2007-07-25
I'm sorry if I seem impatient, but I'd really like to have sound.
If OSS supports my audio, well, what can I do now?  I'm still somewhat of a newbie here.

Who could tell?
A good start would be to check how to revert the changes you made by following the guide you mentioned earlier.  

May be you could give the forum some more hints. 
lsmod | grep snd

to see which sound modules are (auto)loaded.
Check if the module for your soundcard is loaded.
For example my onboard soundcard from nvidia uses  snd_intel8x0,snd_ac97_codec (amongst others)
ls /proc/asound/
to see if any soundcards are present

Did you try a live distro like Knoppix - Mr Knopper puts a lot of modules on his Live DVD's - and usually if it works with Knoppix you are sure your hardware is supported - then you know if it makes sense to put some effort in getting your desired distro to work with your hardware.

Also important to send a service request to mobo retailer, manufacturer just to make sure that you care about their hardware being supported by all OS!

Also, I'm just going with plain 32-bit x86, now, rather than x86-64.  Same problem, though.

I might give it a shot, though I can't guarantee that my DVD burner would not explode during the process.

Thanks.

lsmod output seems quite sane -you have a supported High Definition Audio soundcard therefore snd_hda_intel, ALSA add-on OSS/Free emulation modules are loaded as well, now for your own benefit you can read
less /proc/asound/cards
less /proc/asound/devices
or post it here

You could also try System-Preferences-Audio to choose and test the output device
You could post by which means you tried to get sound response - i.e which program with which audio settings.

HTHI've done that several times now, and none of the options produce any sound.
None of the playback methods give any outright errors, except for OSS:
```
audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink: Resource busy or not available.
```
Not sure if that's relevant or not.

I've tried many applications, including VLC, a few games, Flash, but no luck.

Did you try xmms, alsamixer?

Just wondering did your sound work before the kernel upgrade?Try booting in with the old kernel.

Uh, how do I do that? :lol:

I'll give that a shot, hold on.

Edit:  Nope, still doesn't work.

Eh, after a little searching, I found [this]("https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/yelp/+question/9928").  The method he used might be worth a shot.
I just wonder why one would have to do that just to get the onboard audio to work.

Edit:  Nope, didn't work.  The card I put in worked, but it didn't enable my onboard audio as it did John K.
Actually, I just realized I didn't follow the third step.  Hold on.
EDIT 2: RETURN OF EDIT:  Onboard still doesn't work, even with the sound card in.

I share this problem.

My sound works fine under Windows but since switching to Ubuntu six months ago i have never been able to get the sound to work.  It crackles regardless of volume level.  This is true in all applications that play audio, including all the TEST buttons in the Sound Preferences dialog in Gnome.  I have a Asus F3T notebook, which uses ALC861VD Analog.  I think the ALSA wiki tells me i should be using snd-hda-intel, which I am.  Please help.
