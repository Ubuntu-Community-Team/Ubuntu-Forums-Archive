I have my speakers hooked up to my sound card (not onboard). When hooked up to onboard everything works fine.

However when hooked up to my Audigy 2 I get sound in only some things.

In System->Preferences-> Sound, I can click "Test" and it works fine. I get the sound notifications from Pidgin fine.

Things like Music, internet videos etc, don't have sound.

I'm guessing there is an option I have to enable somewhere but I don't know where to look.

I can type aplay -1 and i get:
