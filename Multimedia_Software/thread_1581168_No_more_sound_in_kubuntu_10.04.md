Hi,
I have installed lucid some months ago and everything worked fine, but since about 10 days I have no more sound at all (vlc/amarok/you tube)... I have looked in the past threads, installed and unsinstalled pulseaudio, checked that I am not mute in alsamixer, but it still doesn't work. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Here are the outputs of some commands:

$ aplay -l
```

This was after an update? Use the alsa-info-script to provide detailed information.
Run this command in a terminal:
```
wget http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh -O alsa-info.sh && bash alsa-info.sh 
```
Choose the upload option and provide a link for the output.
