title: "Nvidia does not play well with 8.10"

### Post by uwc on 2009-01-26
I have been trying for two weeks now to get my nvidia 7900 GS to work with Ubuntu 8.10.

<rant>
It worked with 7.04,7.10,8.04 and then some(censored)body changed something and has now caused much grief for everyone. I have read many different posts on many different boards and spent hours googling errors messages.
</rant>

so here is where I'm at:
Ubuntu 8.10 with the latest upgrades
nvidia 810.22
dual Acer 1916W (1440x900 native)

What I get is both screens 1280x1024 mirroring each other.

What should I try next? (clean install is out of the question)

Are you using the pre-installed nvidia driver?

---

### Post by uwc on 2009-01-27
I am using the driver from nvidia 810.22. The only place you can get it ( that I know of) is the nvidia site.

I have also tried the 177 and 173 drives as installed by envy and envy-gt

### Post by cariboo on 2009-01-27
I would suggest starting  from scratch. Remove all traces of nvidia drivers using Synaptic to completely remove the drivers and anything else that has nvidia in the name. Then create an new /etc/X11/xorg.conf by starting in recovery mode and  selecting xfix at the menu, then resume to the desktop and see if there is anything in System-->Administration-->Hardware Drivers. If there is, select it and wait until it tells you yu need to restart X. The drivrs have to be downloaded so if the server you are using is slow, you'll have to be patient.

All traces of nvidia have been removed with synaptic. (nvidia drivers currently installed by NVIDIA*.run (810.22) do not show in synaptic). Booted into recovery mode and created new xorg.conf. Resumed. hardware drives tell me "No proprietary drivers are in use on this system"

---

### Post by uwc on 2009-01-27
I run nvidia-uninstall to remove the 810.22 drivers and reran the same steps with the same results

### Post by Starhero on 2009-01-28
I am having simular issues. everything was fine until I decided to upgrade my drivers (since I was gettinga black flashing at times and someone suggested to go higher then 177)

When I try to install any higher drives, 180.22 or 180.25, I first got a 

"Can not load module "type1""

Commenting that out of xorg.conf, it then gave me

Screens found but none have configureations that are useable

I think tryed to manually edit xorg.conf and add 1024x768 JUST TO GET BOOTED and, no luck.

This is frustrating, trying to fix one problem slapped on 10 more.

I have installed the new drivres all the differn't ways possible. Taking out all nvidia remininets from synaptic and then installing via nividiaaliaes and restricted drivers. I have also got the installer from nvidia themselves and still no avail.

Am I missing something?

Please see [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/321741](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/321741) for more info.

or even better add to it.

### Post by uwc on 2009-01-29
I see Nvidia driver ver 810.25 mentioned. Anybody know where I can get it? Is it still in development?

---

### Post by uwc on 2009-01-31
Well I've tried a couple more things but still no luck.
Somebody got it working on a single monitor but not dual. I unplugged one of my monitors but there was no difference.

Somebody else said that 64 bit worked where 32 bit didn't. Maybe I should move to 64 bit?

### Post by jsearles on 2009-02-01
The only way I have been able to make it work is to disable my onboard adapter. That's right, no dual monitors for now.  I just found this out so, I have yet to try other means of setting up dual monitors. After 12 solid hours of searching for the current answer, I'll start on that problem tomorrow.

btw, it seems that either the driver or xorg is having trouble differentiating the adapters. Both of mine are Nvidia. I hate them with a passion.

---

### Post by jsearles on 2009-02-01
btw unlugging won't do it. You have to go into the BIOS and disable it.

---

### Post by terry31415 on 2009-03-04
i was having issues getting any nvidia driver to activate. Solved problem accidently by booting into desktop generic instead of server. there is probably a reason but right now i'm not worrying.good luck

if you have two monitors on one card:
start Applications--Accessories--Terminal
type gksu nvidia-settings{ENTER}
enter password
click on X  Server Display Configuration
click on Detect Displays
click on Configure
click the TwinView radio buton
click OK
set up whatever else you want set and click Save to X Configuration File

Heh, from my experience personally I'd strongly recommend keeping well away from all the nvidia gui installers and learning a bit about good old /etc/X11/xorg.conf.

As for earlier posters with dual displays not working, keep trying, it is worth it :)
