a while ago i posted a thread about vlc flickering when playing dvds, i was told to change the video output to X11 i did this and it worked fine. However i seem to get a similar problem with other programs but i cant change the video output on them, is there any thing i can do to fix this and what causes it?

Thanks

* GStreamer (The default video player in Ubuntu, totem-gstreamer, and any video player that is based on the gstreamer backend)
o Open a terminal and type "gstreamer-properties". Press Enter.
o Click the Video tab.
o Under Default Video Plugin select "X Window System (No Xv)".
o Click Test to verify that video playback is working (you should be able to see the standard TV testing colour stripes).
o Click Close

* VLC (VLC is not installed by default; you need to search in the package manager, then install)
o Start VLC and click on Settings, then Preferences.
o Expand Video and then expand Output modules. You will notice several options for output device.
o Select the item Output modules, and notice the checkbox at the bottom right that says Advanced options. Check the box, and now you have the option to select a different output device.
o Pick X11 video output
o Click on Save and you are set!

* MPlayer 
o Start Mplayer
o Right-click on the screen and select Preferences
o Select the Video tab and under Available Drivers select "X11 (XImage/Shm)"
o Click Save and restart the program for the setting to take effect.
+ Some users reported that MPlayer may not be able to show videos in full screen.

* Xine
o Start xine
o Click File, then Configure and then Preferences
o In experience_level select "Master Of The Known Universe" so that all available settings are visible.
o Select the tab for video.
o Under Driver select "xshm".
o Restart xine.
+ The same process enables Totem that has the totem-xine backend configured.
