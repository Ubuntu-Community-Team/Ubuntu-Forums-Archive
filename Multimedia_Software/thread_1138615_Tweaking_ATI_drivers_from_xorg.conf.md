title: "Tweaking ATI drivers from xorg.conf"

From [here]("http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9951") I read and installed the ATI drivers (though the real drivers were already installed by me before).

Though there's a major performance boost but there're still many issues and the card is still preforming a fraction of what it used to in windows.


I think tweaking and playing around with the xorg.conf file will help.

Currently I'm not using RadionHD drivers, I cannot enable desktop effects using those drivers (they are installed but the xorg.conf is configured not to use them).

C'mon!...someone should know!...no one has an ATI here?

If you are havng hardware problems it would help a lot if you were sepcific about your hardware, the version of ubuntu you are using and everything you tried.

Otherwise I could just tell you that that driver does not support your card.

Chipset ATI RS690 (or 690G...the opensource driver docs claim it to have full 3-d support, which doesn't seem so) which comes with x1270 graphs chip.

Ubuntu 8.10

There were no radion drivers installed in the OS initially (there was an ATI driver wrappers though), problem was I could not see any video (forget 3-d)...or actually nothing was happening except the desktop effects getting enabled and very slow.

I also tried the proprietor drivers, but they did not work...they gave flicking videos.

Then I reinstalled ubuntu and upgraded the driver wrapper (which came pre-installed), apart from that I also installed the radion drivers this time; this result in videos getting played properly and 3-d rendering, but the 3-d rendering was very slow, so were the desktop effects (even the simple GUI was very slow).

I also tried the HD drives after reading this article

[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonHD](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonHD)

And realised this article was crap.

I also tried this - 

[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver)

And it was also crap.

In the above 2 links, they ask to modify the xrog.conf file, after which every rendering stops (and I boot into commandline)


Then I came across this article - 

[http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9951](http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9951)

Which also contained the setting of the xorg.conf file which worked perfectly and so my desktop effects and 3-d rendering performance multiplied.

It also explained how to activate the radionHD drivers (which are still installed) but that disables the desktop effects...so HD wont work with my GPU.

Still there are many issues - 

1)Performance still a fraction to what it was in windows.

2)3-d rendering issues.

3)Slow GUI (scrolling and all with the desktop effects still being slow)


Aero used to work perfectly with this IGP, so it is of course suffice to handle gnome effects.

I went to ATI's website; yes I tried the x1200 and 1250 drivers (I did this in a separate installation), but that ruined my display.

Dell does not provide such drivers.

I'm actually getting used to the slow browsing you know.

Do you have "smooth scrolling" on?  When used in conjunction with composite managers (Compiz, Kwin, etc.) it can cause slow scrolling.

### Post by Yellow Pasque on 2009-05-02
As you've discovered, the 690G isn't the best GPU, and Linux graphics performance usually pales compared to Windows (especially with ATI), so let's not expect miracles.

Please post output of:
```
LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo
```
Your /var/log/Xorg.0.log may help too.

I guess I should admit that I'm actually the author of the RadeonHD Ubuntu doc. /me *ducks :P

[quote=Melcar]Do you have "smooth scrolling" on? When used in conjunction with composite managers (Compiz, Kwin, etc.) it can cause slow scrolling.[/quote]

Ok...that did help by a lot, but that's like turning off effects cause your hardware is not preforming at its full potential (actually a fraction) cause of software issues.

So instead of that, how do I tweak the drivers so as to make things faster?

Linux graphs performance is better than windows atleast from what I saw in the benchmarks, and with the current proprietary drivers that ATI provides in their websites, Linux preformed better than windows.

I saw that ATI benchmark comparisn in the opensource drivers site, so you should be familier with that (since........you made the docs)

This card can draw ~30FPS in doom3 @ high graphs setting at 1280*800...why do you think it wont be able to handle gnome effects with perfect fluidity?:shock:

Sorry for the negative comment on that guide for the HD drivers...but that really did not work.

So instead of that, how do I tweak the drivers so as to make things faster?

The smooth scrolling thing is more of a Firefox + composition fault than of the driver.

I have no problems on my laptop (Core2/T7200, x1700 GPU) on 8.10(32bit).  It was frustrating for me for a while, also.  Are you still having the video flickering problem while special effects are turned on?  Try turning if off and you will see the flicker go away.  They solved this in 9.04 from what I can see on my desktop.  I just checked on this laptop and it is still there with effects turned on.  I feel your pain as I spent many hours trying to figure it out.  On my desktop is 9.04(64bit) with a ATI 4650.  Granted, it has an Intel Q9550 and 8Gigs of Ram, but the flicker is gone even though special effects are on.  
     On the issue of 3d desktop effects, it has caused me much frustration, also, but it does work for the most part, on the x1700.  I just kept playing with the settings. I can have the rotating cube desktop without a problem.  I don't use it that much any longer though.  It was nice to play with.  
     Here is a guide I ran across a while ago, but have not viewed it in quite a while.  

[http://tnerd.com/2008/11/13/compiz-fusion-guide-a-complete-guide-to-install-compiz-fusion-in-ubuntu-post-1/](http://tnerd.com/2008/11/13/compiz-fusion-guide-a-complete-guide-to-install-compiz-fusion-in-ubuntu-post-1/)

     I know I have a little less hair after messing with compiz for a while!  Keep on going.  I just hope the ATI drivers/Control Center get better for 9.04 soon!  With the 4650, I can't get some little things to like Xinerama (ability to open a movie in a full screen on the second monitor, etc) I got the desktop extended, but when I go fullscreen on a VLC movie, it splits it between the 22inch monitor and my Sharp 32" lcd.  Frustrating to say the least.  I am about to make the jump to Nvidia!
      Have a good day and I hope you figure it out.  :lolflag:

No no...no problem with the videos now but certain issues with CAD/animation programs and slow effects/FPS in the animation software.

You can install the drivers provided by ATI...............no!...we don't have drivers for x1700!...god damn!...and I thought I was the only one in this category!

Also you can tweak the xorg.conf file and install the radion drivers in addition to the ati-video drivers.

> I feel your pain as I spent many hours trying to figure it out.

Thanks man...but :lolflag: I'm used to it...cracking/understanding scientific concepts is much difficult than this...all this is done in fee time as 'entertainment':D

We have drivers for 4600 series -

I don't see anything wrong with your glxinfo or Xorg log. You may want to try manually specifying the Virtual screen size to 1280x800, i.e your xorg.conf would look like:
```
...
Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Default Screen"
	Monitor		"Configured Monitor"
	Device		"Configured Video Device"
        [B]SubSection "Display"
                Depth     24
                Virtual   1280 800
        EndSubSection[/B]
EndSection
...

```

I'm not sure what you're talking about here. The Catalyst 9.3 drivers should install fine on Intrepid: [http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.7&product=2.7.4.3.3.3.1&lang=English](http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.7&product=2.7.4.3.3.3.1&lang=English)
You can install them with this procedure (Note: the commands involving the filename will be slightly different since you're using Catalyst 9.3):

Oh...I said that to someone else.:)

I'll try those drivers in a separate installation cause last time it ruined my system...I got a large square instead of a mouse, and a similar square towards the lower right of the screen.

But that article says I gotta install the 9.4 drivers.

The 9.4 drivers don't support your GPU...

> Linux graphs performance is better than windows atleast from what I saw in the benchmarks, and with the current proprietary drivers that ATI provides in their websites, Linux performed better than windows.
I saw that ATI benchmark comparison in the opensource drivers site, so you should be familiar with that (since........you made the docs)
This card can draw ~30FPS in doom3 @ high graphs setting at 1280*800...why do you think it wont be able to handle gnome effects with perfect fluidity
Sorry, I should have been more clear. When I made 3D performance comparsions, I was referring to ATI Windows vs. open-source ATI drivers. **I don't take fglrx seriously because ATI doesn't either**. With all due respect to the developers, the fglrx drivers are garbage, and I wasn't referring to them when talking about the Windows drivers. Yes, they benchmark well in 3D tasks, but they're horrible in 2D acceleration and general usability.

### Post by dE_logics on 2009-05-03
I did download 9.4...but now I'll download 9.3

Anyway, there's an error in the first line where you gotta "sudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs fakeroot dh-make debhelper debconf libstdc++5 dkms"

It returns - 
```

E: Couldn't find package build-essential

```

Ok I'll try "sudo apt-get install build-essential"

I forget to add 'install' #-o and so it returned an error.

I have the usual square instead of the mouse and a large square on teh lower right screen.

Performance is like....1/200th to the best this card can give.

So...verdict, it did not work.

Any 'options' for the opensource drivers in the xorg.conf file?...again they claim to give full 3-d support for this chipset.

---

### Post by Yellow Pasque on 2009-05-04
You can customize settings to some degree with the driconf package.

aaaaa...what if I landup in commandline? dpkg reconfigure xserver-xorg?

### Post by dE_logics on 2009-05-04
But that's for 3-d rendering only right?...it gave a meniscus boost in 3-d performance.

Anyway can I improve the 2-d performance at least for gnome effects?

### Post by dE_logics on 2009-05-06
There seems to be a new version of the drivers for Jaunty [here]("https://launchpad.net/~tormodvolden/+archive/ppa")

i.e version 6.12.2.99 while for Intrepid its stuck at 6.12.1.

I tried to install the jaunty version, but it says xorg-server's missing, although it's installed.

Any ideas on how to install them without upgrading to Jaunty?
