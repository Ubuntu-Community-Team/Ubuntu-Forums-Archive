Have been going through the other posts .... haven't been able to completely restore sound functionality after a fresh install of Hardy.  Currently have sound coming out of my front speakers only via Amarok (have 5.1 working previously) and only static coming out of the tv tuner.
I've attached the results of the lspci & lsmod |grep snd commands ... 

Here is the /home/userid/ .asoundrc 
[SIZE="2"]#########################################################
#This is the standard setting (see: “!default”)
#This profile, the default loaded, upmixes stereo sound to 5.1.

pcm.!dmix {
   type plug
   slave {
       pcm surround51
       channels 6
   }
}
pcm.!default {
   type plug
   slave.pcm "dmix"
   slave.channels 6
   route_policy duplicate
}
[/SIZE]

Here is the /etc/.asound.conf
[SIZE="2"]# Set default sound card
# Useful so that all settings can be changed to a different card here.
pcm.snd_card {
     type hw
     card 0

pcm.dmixer {
     type dmix
     ipc_key 1024
     slave.pcm "snd_card"
     slave {
          # This stuff provides some fixes for latency issues.
