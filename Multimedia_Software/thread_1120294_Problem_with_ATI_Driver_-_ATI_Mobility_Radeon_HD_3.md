### Post by 95lcecil94 on 2009-04-08
Hello,

I'm having a problem with the newest ATI driver, 9.3. As mentioned, my card is an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3650. I'm using Ubuntu 8.04.

After installing the driver, and then rebooting, Ubuntu just reboots after the loading bar. 

I tried installing it using the guide here [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI) and also using the one on ATI's own site, [https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_cat92-inst.pdf](https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_cat92-inst.pdf)

Both yield the same result, an unbootable system. It seems like it's a problem with the xorg file, as I was able to boot up my system again after using a backup of my xorg.conf file. Using the restricted drivers by going into System->Administration->Hardware Drivers works, and they are the ones I use right now, but I'd rather use the newest version of the drivers, as I've heard they are better performance wise.

I should probably mention, that I'm still kind of a newbie at Linux (only been using it for about a month or so..).

I also tried using EnvyNG to install the drivers, it can boot after this, but it doesn't seem to be using the drivers correctly, as fglrxinfo results in the Mesa message.

Let me know, if I should post any more information.

Thanks.

I hate to do this, but *BUMP*.

If it's the fault of the graphics driver, you should file a bug report directly to ATi.

Other than that, have you tried an older version from ATi? (maybe it works better? [This]("http://www.phoronix.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=19") (Phoronix) is a good place to search for some information on the matter.

Hi,

Thanks for your reply, as I'm writing this, I'm currently downloading the 9.1 version of the driver, hopefully this will work. Thanks for the link, too, I'll have a look around that site.

Well, I tried installing the 9.1 version of the drivers. This time the computer didn't reboot, but instead I got a black screen with some colors scattered across the screen, I could hear the sound, though.

ATI is a hell, there's nothing but problems with their drivers.

I've pretty much tried everything I can think of so far, but to no luck, guess I'm just gonna have to stick to the drivers that come with Ubuntu 8.04.

Also, I looked around at the site you linked, and read that other people seem to be having problems with the drivers on Linux with Mobility Radeon HD 3650. Someone posted a possible fix, but it didn't work for me.

There is a problem with that driver and the mobility HD3650 which, if anyone cared to read the release notes, is not listed. Anyway, what people have discovered is that the driver will not work if you have more than 2GB ram.

### Post by 95lcecil94 on 2009-04-10
Oh ok, sorry for not reading the release notes :P. As I have 3 GB of RAM I guess that's the problem. I'll just have to go through the release notes on each of the drivers, and hope that one of them supports my card.

Thanks for your reply, btw.

Just looked at the release notes for a couple of drivers, and it seems that pretty much none of the versions support my card.

Is the driver, that Ubuntu includes, modified in some way?

all the drivers up to 9.3 which I did don try because I switched to JJ worked well on my machine with asus ah 3650  (a.k.a. HD 3650 ATI) even though I have 3GB RAM.

I was thinking of trying out 9.04 to see if anything works better there.

Also, do you by any chance have an ASUS laptop?

Mine is the M50SA model.

Oh ok, well according to the release notes of the drivers, the desktop version of the HD 3650 is supported, but the mobility version isn't.

Will probably just be a matter of time before ATi will bring up a new driver which will add support for your graphics chip then, I think.

I too have the same card, i am using ati driver which is open source. I cannot use the fglrx even today, I have dual graphics card, hd 3200 and hd3650. seems there is some big time issue with my laptop with dual graphics card... ati support sucks. I have contacted them through email but no response till now...

If you still have this problem. You should read the thread I started for my laptop. It has a Mobility FireGL v5700 AKA "HD3650" There are a cupple things you need to do the most important is after installing the driver and seting up xorg.conf. You need to run this command before you reboot.

_This is what you need to turn off ACPI support for your ATI grafics card to avoide the Kernel Panic when X starts._
```
sudo aticonfig --acpi-services=off
```

Nope, followed your instructions, I still get issues it boots to the gibberish screen. Open source drivers are working perfectly for me except for the 3d effects of course :-(...

BTW I do not have an option to not shutting fan on ac power. My bios does not support it.

I get the following error of invalid bios code.

why don't you try this: [http://blog.sbw.be/2009/06/18/ubuntu-ati-hd-3650-elitebook/](http://blog.sbw.be/2009/06/18/ubuntu-ati-hd-3650-elitebook/) - i don't have the card, but i was trying to help someone out in the support channel and came across this.

I think my issue is that I have dual graphics card on the laptop I have. One hd3200 and another hd3650. I have filed a bug in launchpad, lets see if it resolves the issue.
