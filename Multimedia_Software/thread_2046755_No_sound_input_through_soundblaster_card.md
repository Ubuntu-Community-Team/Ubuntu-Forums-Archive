Hello,
Just getting my computer set up to use for music production.
I have a soundblaster audigy platinum ex.
I have been using Hydrogen and Ardour with Jack and am having some success. Got sound out from the back pci output and from the front box headphone out. 
Problem is I can't seem to get any sound into my system using the back inputs or the front inputs. Any ideas would be appreciated.
Here is what the terminal spits out with arecord -l && aplay -l:

Ok, I have sound into my card now. I installed gnome alsa mixer and found the right sliders. Having all sorts of other issues with jack etc now!! But I guess that is a different thread. I will be back when I can muster the enthusiasm to tackle it again!
