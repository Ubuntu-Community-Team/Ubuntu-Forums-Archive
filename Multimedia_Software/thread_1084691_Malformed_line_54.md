title: "Malformed line 54?"

### Post by missbliss on 2009-03-02
I keep getting this error now:

```
sarah@sarah-laptop:~$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
E: Malformed line 54 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)
E: The list of sources could not be read.
sarah@sarah-laptop:~$ apt-get update
E: Malformed line 54 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)

```

This occured after I was following instructions to get winff.  I can't open synaptic anymore, either.  This is the error message I get when I try to run Synaptic:

> E: Malformed line 54 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)
E: The list of sources could not be read.
Go to the repository dialog to correct the problem.
E: _cache->open() failed, please report.

I am having the same problem. In attempting to install Java in Ubuntu 10.04 I have somehow caused the update manager to give me this message: 
"An unresolvable problem occurred while initializing the package information.
Please report this bug against the 'update-manager' package and include the following error message:
'E:Malformed line 54 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse), E:The list of sources could not be read.'

The last thing I did was add the Medibuntu repository.

Open a terminal and type

```
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```

and change the last line to

```
deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu lucid partner
```
