Upgraded from 10.10 after trying out the live CD. In the live CD I had full 3d Unity desktop, but after upgrading I am in classic mode and trying to log into unity just freezes my computer. 

this is my video card:
VGA compatible controller [0300]: ATI Technologies Inc RS690M [Radeon X1200 Series] [1002:791f]

other possibly useful info:
dmesg | grep drm
[   27.132335] [drm] Initialized drm 1.1.0 20060810
[   27.753394] [drm] VGACON disable radeon kernel modesetting.

[   27.758718] [drm] No driver support for vblank timestamp query.

[  119.880242] [drm] writeback test succeeded in 1 usecs

Also :
sudo lshw -C video
  *-display UNCLAIMED     
       description: VGA compatible controller
       product: RS690M [Radeon X1200 Series]
       vendor: ATI Technologies Inc
       physical id: 5
       bus info: pci@0000:01:05.0
       version: 00
       width: 64 bits
       clock: 33MHz
       capabilities: pm msi vga_controller bus_master cap_list
       configuration: latency=64
       resources: memory:e0000000-efffffff memory:fe9f0000-fe9fffff ioport:ee00(size=256) memory:fea00000-feafffff


there is some interesting help at [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver) haven't had any luck yet though

Also I am running in nomodeset kernal option as this made compiz work for me in 10.10 I have also tried running without nomodeset option but this is what freezes when I try to log into untiy

thanks for any help in advance
