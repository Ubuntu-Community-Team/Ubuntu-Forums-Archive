I've been trying to get this driver installed for 2 days now.  I get into the installer but get an error when it tries to compile the driver.  I know that the installer wants the source code of the kernel, so I have installed "linux-source-2.6.28" with Synaptic.  Is that the right file?  I am using an XFX nforce 630i geforce 7100.  I know that some people have had success with this driver on this chipset. I am using Ubuntu 9.04 and my kernel is 2.6.28-13-generic.  Here is what my log says.

Using: nvidia-installer ncurses user interface
-> License accepted.
-> No precompiled kernel interface was found to match your kernel; would you li
   ke the installer to attempt to download a kernel interface for your kernel f
   rom the NVIDIA ftp site ([ftp://download.nvidia.com)?]("ftp://download.nvidia.com%29?") (Answer: Yes)
-> No matching precompiled kernel interface was found on the NVIDIA ftp site;
   this means that the installer will need to compile a kernel interface for
   your kernel.
-> Performing CC sanity check with CC="cc".
-> Performing CC version check with CC="cc".
-> Kernel source path: '/lib/modules/2.6.28-13-generic/build'
-> Kernel output path: '/lib/modules/2.6.28-13-generic/build'
ERROR: If you are using a Linux 2.4 kernel, please make sure
       you either have configured kernel sources matching your
       kernel or the correct set of kernel headers installed
       on your system.
       
       If you are using a Linux 2.6 kernel, please make sure
       you have configured kernel sources matching your kernel
       installed on your system. If you specified a separate
       output directory using either the "KBUILD_OUTPUT" or
       the "O" KBUILD parameter, make sure to specify this
       directory with the SYSOUT environment variable or with
       the equivalent nvidia-installer command line option.
       
       Depending on where and how the kernel sources (or the
       kernel headers) were installed, you may need to specify
       their location with the SYSSRC environment variable or
       the equivalent nvidia-installer command line option.
ERROR: Installation has failed.  Please see the file
       '/var/log/nvidia-installer.log' for details.  You may find suggestions
       on fixing installation problems in the README available on the Linux
       driver download page at [www.nvidia.com]("http://www.nvidia.com").
