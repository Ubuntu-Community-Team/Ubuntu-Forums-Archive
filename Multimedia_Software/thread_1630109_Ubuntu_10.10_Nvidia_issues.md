I have two Nvidia dual port video cards in my system with three monitors attached. If I enable the nvidia drivers, the Nvidia X Serve Configuration manager will see both video boards and all three monitors the first time it is configured. But after a re-boot or two, only two of the monitors will work.

Here is my xorg.conf file:

```

EndSection

```

Any ideas why this is happening?

It also appears that Xinerama needs to be used as the nvidia driver does not allow using TwinView between video cards.
