I have a Dell T3500 with Ubuntu 18.04 installed.  I have poked around trying to find an answer but, no luck.  I only have sound on the right channel, no stereo.  I have confirmed this through sound settings and testing my speakers.  I ran amixer -c 0 and under Playback Channels it is listed as Mono.  How do I change that to stereo?
