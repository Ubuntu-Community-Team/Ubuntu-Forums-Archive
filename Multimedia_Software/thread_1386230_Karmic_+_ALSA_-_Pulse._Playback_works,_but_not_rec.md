title: "Karmic + ALSA - Pulse. Playback works, but not record."

### Post by utannheim on 2010-01-20
I have upgraded from 9.04 to 9.10. Both playback and record were working using only ALSA. Karmic installed PulseAudio. Looking around the forums I found a post on how to update to the latest ALSA driver (+ lib + utils) and remove pulse to take it out of the equation. With or without pulse I cannot get record working. For work I need to use my laptop as a softphone. I've tested my headset on another machine - headphones and mic both work. Any suggestions on how to resolve this would be greatly appreciated. 

I have a Thinkpad T61P. Below is the output of some hopefully useful commands ...
