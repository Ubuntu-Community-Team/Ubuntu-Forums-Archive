hello i installed ubuntu 8.04 and followed the setup process from the forum for an nvidia geforce mx440 se agp8x.then i inconter resolution,3d,close, maximize,minimize problems. i'll post the xorg.conf as well to see the changes(removed the #### lines).the original xorgconf:
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Generic Keyboard"
	Driver		"kbd"
	Option		"XkbRules"	"xorg"
	Option		"XkbModel"	"pc105"
	Option		"XkbLayout"	"us"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Configured Mouse"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"CorePointer"
EndSection

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Configured Video Device"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier	"Configured Monitor"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Default Screen"
	Monitor		"Configured Monitor"
	Device		"Configured Video Device"
EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"Default Layout"
	Screen		"Default Screen"
EndSection

first step: i installed the nvidia proprietary driver nvidia glx trought add\remove or edgyNG same result. after restart the maximum resolution is 640X480 here is the xorg.conf:
Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Default Screen"
	Monitor		"Configured Monitor"
	Device		"Configured Video Device"
	Option		"AddARGBGLXVisuals"	"True"
	Defaultdepth	24
EndSection

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Configured Video Device"
	Driver		"nvidia"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Generic Keyboard"
	Driver		"kbd"
	Option		"XkbRules"	"xorg"
	Option		"XkbModel"	"pc105"
	Option		"XkbLayout"	"us"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Configured Mouse"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"CorePointer"
EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"Default Layout"
  screen "Default Screen"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
	Identifier	"Configured Monitor"
EndSection

Section "Extensions"
	Option		"Composite"	"Enable"
EndSection

second step: sudo nvidia-settings and setup the res to 1024X768 and 60 hz refesh the max for my monitor and save that to xorg.conf via the button. after restart the up and down panels rearenge the buttons in random order
and if i enable the visuals effects extra and the min/max/close disapears and 3d don't work at all and the terminal is all white:
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier     "Default Layout"

    Option         "XkbLayout" "us"
EndSection
