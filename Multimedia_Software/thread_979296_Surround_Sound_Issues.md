### Post by apollo23 on 2008-11-11
I am currently using a Creative X-fi XtremeMusic sound card and I am trying to get sound using a 5.1 speaker configuration.  I can currently hear sound just find out of 2 of my speakers but the other 3 and sub-woofer are not making any sound.  Here are the files I have tried to mess with..

My:  gedit ~/.asoundrc   is blank

I have also tried my gedit ~/.asoundrc:

> # my shared device with 5.1 upmix 

pcm.shared_surround {
    type plug
    slave.pcm "surround51"
    slave.channels 6
    route_policy duplicate
}

# make the default device use pulse (all alsa apps will use it and mix)

pcm.!default {
    type pulse
}

ctl.!default {
    type pulse
}

My: gedit ~/.pulse/daemon.conf
> # $Id: daemon.conf.in 2175 2008-03-27 23:39:10Z lennart $

.nofail

### Load something into the sample cache
#load-sample-lazy x11-bell /usr/share/sounds/gtk-events/activate.wav
#load-sample-lazy pulse-hotplug /usr/share/sounds/startup3.wav
#load-sample-lazy pulse-coldplug /usr/share/sounds/startup3.wav
#load-sample-lazy pulse-access /usr/share/sounds/generic.wav

.fail

### Load audio drivers statically (it's probably better to not load
### these drivers manually, but instead use module-hal-detect --
### see below -- for doing this automatically)
#load-module module-alsa-sink
#load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0
#load-module module-oss device="/dev/dsp" sink_name=output source_name=input
#load-module module-oss-mmap device="/dev/dsp" sink_name=output source_name=input
#load-module module-null-sink
#load-module module-pipe-sink

### Automatically load driver modules depending on the hardware available
.ifexists module-hal-detect.so
load-module module-hal-detect
.else
### Alternatively use the static hardware detection module (for systems that
### lack HAL support)
load-module module-detect
.endif

### Load several protocols
.ifexists module-esound-protocol-unix.so
load-module module-esound-protocol-unix
.endif
load-module module-native-protocol-unix

### Network access (may be configured with paprefs, so leave this commented
### here if you plan to use paprefs)
#load-module module-esound-protocol-tcp
#load-module module-native-protocol-tcp
#load-module module-zeroconf-publish

### Load the RTP reciever module (also configured via paprefs, see above)
#load-module module-rtp-recv

### Load the RTP sender module (also configured via paprefs, see above)
#load-module module-null-sink sink_name=rtp format=s16be channels=2 rate=44100 description="RTP Multicast Sink"
#load-module module-rtp-send source=rtp.monitor

### Load additional modules from GConf settings. This can be configured with the paprefs tool.
### Please keep in mind that the modules configured by paprefs might conflict with manually
### loaded modules.
.ifexists module-gconf.so
.nofail
load-module module-gconf
.fail
.endif

### Automatically restore the volume of playback streams
load-module module-volume-restore

### Automatically restore the default sink/source when changed by the user during runtime
load-module module-default-device-restore

### Automatically move streams to the default sink if the sink they are
### connected to dies, similar for sources
load-module module-rescue-streams

### Automatically suspend sinks/sources that become idle for too long
load-module module-suspend-on-idle

### Load X11 bell module
#load-module module-x11-bell sample=x11-bell

### Register ourselves in the X11 session manager
# Deactivated by default, to avoid deadlock when PA is started as esd from gnome-session
# Instead we load this via /etc/xdg/autostart/ and "pactl load-module" now
# load-module module-x11-xsmp

### Publish connection data in the X11 root window
.ifexists module-x11-publish.so
.nofail
load-module module-x11-publish
.fail
.endif

### Make some devices default
#set-default-sink output
#set-default-source input

I am not really sure what Pulse Audio is but I haven't installed any pulse programs (or at least I don't think I did).  If you have any ideas on how I can get 5.1 sound I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for all of your help.

Take a look at sammydee's [Surround Sound in PulseAudio]("http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=795525") guide.

Thanks for the tread.  I did consult this tread before I started.  The problem is I followed the steps listed under his "easy configuration" and I still have no surround sound.  I am confused as to what to do next.
