This is from another post I made but I'm still having the same problem.

When I do Update Manager I get this error.

''Could not download all repository indexes



The repository might be no longer available or could not be contacted because of network problems. If available an older version of the failed index will be used. Otherwise the repository will be ignored. Check your network connection and the correct writing of the repository address in the preferences.

Would you like to do```
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```in a terminal and paste it here?

Could be that Ubuntu server is having problem or more likely you might want to go into software sources and make sure all of the sources are properly checked including universe and multi-universe and then reload when you exit, if prompted and then restart your machine and then try again.

Good luck.
