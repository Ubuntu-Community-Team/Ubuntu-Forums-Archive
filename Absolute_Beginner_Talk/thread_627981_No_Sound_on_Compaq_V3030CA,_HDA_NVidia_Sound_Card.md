It's driving me crazy :(

There's sound in Vista but Linux world is silent. However, I have audio when booting from the Live CD. This only seems to be a problem when I boot from the installation (Gutsy, 7.10)

lspci returns:

My sound is definitely not muted, and I've tried different devices to no avail.

When I go to test the sound in System>Preferences>Sound I get this error:

```
audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 !
audioconvert ! audioresample !
gconfaudiosink: Could not open resource for
writing
```

The full reinstall of ALSA as directed in the Comprehensive Sound Guide did not work.

A bucket of popcorn to the person/people who help(s) solve this. :popcorn:

If you need any other info about my computer just ask.

Thanks
