Video seems to be working fine, but, would like to know what this means. I am using a nvida TNT model 64 video card, 16mb. All I had to use as far as PCI video cards.

See [http://krazypenguin.net/Ubuntu_Dapper_Drake_6.06_Guide#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28NVIDIA.29](http://krazypenguin.net/Ubuntu_Dapper_Drake_6.06_Guide#How_to_install_Graphics_Driver_.28NVIDIA.29)
I used this and have installed Nvidia. It is mostly about changing "nv" to "nvidia" iin the section:

Section "Device"
Identifier "NVIDIA Corporation NV5M64 [RIVA TNT2 Model 64/Model 64 Pro]"
Driver "nv"
BusID "PCI:0:9:0"
EndSection
