from that I get that the onboard sound is the one to go with. Right click the sound icon at top right and select preferences and make sure alsa is selected. Then go to applications-system-prferences in the main menu - select sound and make sure alsa is selected. If you see "oss" anywhere than you need to change that to alsa by clicking the arrow and choosing alsa. If that doesn't solve it come back here. :)
