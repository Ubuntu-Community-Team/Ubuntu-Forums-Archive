First off, shut down your computer fully. Reboot and if it still has no sound, the second thing to do is go into Sytem/Preferences/Sound and look at "Default Mixer Tracks" and switch them out, if nothing there, use that same tool to try the other buttons listed and "Test" each one to see if you get any sound.
