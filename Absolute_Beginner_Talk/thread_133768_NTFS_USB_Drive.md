OK this is what I want to do. 

I want to use ubuntu as a file server for windows/mac network and use my two usb drives formated NTFS for storage.

Drives get mounted read only and are shared via SAMBA, but when I try to access them from my windows box, I get unauthorized user error.

I can't chmod the usb drives, altho I can read the files.

Here are my stats:

df -h

Any ideas?

Of course you can't chmod them when they're mounted read only ;-)

So how does your Samba setup look like - THATS the imporant thing! What kind of error do you get exactly? You say you can read the files? Where/when does this auth error appear then?

If you want the files on your USB drives to belong to a specific user/group, then add the options uid=xxxx,gid=xxxx to your fstab lines.

Ofcourse :) The windows error is that the drive is not accessible and that I may not have permission to acces the drive. 

The /home and /bill are accessible and I can use those with no problems

Here is my smb.conf

#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) 
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentary and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not many any basic syntactic

Hmm when I remember right you need to enable "guest account = nobody" (just remove the comment sign ; ) when you are on "share" security. Also, I'd enable wins support (wins support = yes). Please try this and tell me how it's working (don't forget to reload Samba, sudo /etc/init.d/samba reload)

Thanks for your help..

Here are the changes that I made:

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
  wins support = yes

# "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
# in this server for every user accessing the server. See
# /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/ServerType.html in the samba-doc
# package for details.
   security = share

# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.  
   passdb backend = tdbsam guest

   obey pam restrictions = yes

   guest account = nobody
   invalid users = root

#======================= Share Definitions =======================

wins support = yes
[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   browseable = yes

Still get the No Access allowed error on the USB Drives and No Access for the /home share
