Hi again,

When I try to open Synaptic

the following messages appear

W: Couldn't stat source package list [http://archive.ubuntu.com](http://archive.ubuntu.com) breezy/restricted Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy_restricted_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
W: Couldn't stat source package list [http://archive.ubuntu.com](http://archive.ubuntu.com) breezy-backports/main Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy-backports_main_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
W: Couldn't stat source package list [http://archive.ubuntu.com](http://archive.ubuntu.com) breezy-backports/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy-backports_universe_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)

Any idea 

Maybe this is also related with my previous post on "update error messages"

thx

I think there is some kind of error in the sources file.. Have you edited that file?

yes I have edited that file and now I do not have the original; I think I made a  mistake while backing that up therefore the backup is the same as the original sources file so I think a need a brand new sources file but I do not know whether I can retreive this or not.

thx
