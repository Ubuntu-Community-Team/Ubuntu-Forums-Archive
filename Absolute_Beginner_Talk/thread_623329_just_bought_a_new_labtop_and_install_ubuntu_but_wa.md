Please do this in a terminal window, then copy/paste the results back in a reply here:

lspci


We will need to see what type of video adapter your laptop is using - as an example my old laptop used Via S3 Unichrome Pro and you can't run eye candy like compiz fusion or beryl with it.

So, if you'll do that and post the results back here, maybe we can go from there.

What version of Ubuntu are you using? If you are using 7.10, just go to System>Preferences>Appearance>Visual Effects. You can set effects up from there.
Note, this is Compiz, not Beryl, but Beryl has been outmoded anyway,
Edit: Goodness, this forum moves fast; Two responses while I was typing mine!

Hmm...am I the only one who sees massive letters in the first post?

I once knew an 8-year old like this guy. You're going to want compiz-fusion in the end anyway.

Ôpen synaptic and add the compize comosition management (something).... just search for compiz --> you'll see then which one I mean.

That will add an entry to your system -> preferences and with it you can activate the cube and stuff.

Btw, also post the output of:

```

glxinfo

```

be careful when your being rude, some people have vision problems.---not saying he does but you never know.

In that case it's much more likely that all fonts are bigger by default. So even the standard font size upon writing would be bigger and there would be no need to use the font sizes in the posting itself.

I have to agree with this. My father has vision problems and it helped him when I set all of the fonts on his comp to a larger size. If this guy had similar problems then the fonts he sees would be larger and there would be no need to use such a large font.

I just consider using huge font like that to be plain rude.  I think the OP should first realize that huge font != important [-X

well, 3d is enabled there... hmmm... so correct drivers for your videocard.... dunno what else could cause the problem...

maybe you should keep a terminal open and run within it:

```

top

```

or

```

htop

```

I prefer htop, but it needs to be installed first:
```

sudo apt-get install htop

```

It will show you how much resources each process uses...
