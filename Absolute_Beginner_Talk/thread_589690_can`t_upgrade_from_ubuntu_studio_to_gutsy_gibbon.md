You need to comment out or delete the Wine repos from your sources.list file.  If you need some assistance doing that, post the output of the following command here and I'll walk you through it.  In a terminal (Applications > Accessories >Terminal):
```
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```

You need to disable the third party repos. Like Ubie Studio. Just add 2 ## in front of the line.
