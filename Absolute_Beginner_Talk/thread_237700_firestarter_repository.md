can someone tell me what repository firestarter is in? I tried installing it using apt-get and the package manager,and it can't find it, so I'm thinking I just don't have the correct repositories setup. Here is my source.list file

```


deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted

## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the
## distribution.
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper-updates main restricted
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper-updates main restricted

## Uncomment the following two lines to add software from the 'universe'
## repository.
## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu
## team, and may not be under a free licence. Please satisfy yourself as to
## your rights to use the software. Also, please note that software in

## team.
# deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe
# deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe

## Uncomment the following two lines to add software from the 'backports'
## repository.
## N.B. software from this repository may not have been tested as
## extensively as that contained in the main release, although it includes
## newer versions of some applications which may provide useful features.

## or updates from the Ubuntu security team.
# deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse

deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper-security main restricted
deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper-security main restricted
# deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper-security universe
# deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper-security universe
deb http://www.getautomatix.com/apt dapper main


```

Look in Automatix.  I installed this recently by using the "security suite" in Automatix.  It includes firestarter and ClamAV.

Well you can start by removing the # from the repostorys that ends with *universe* and/or *multiverse*.

It's the following ones:
```
# deb [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) dapper universe
# deb-src [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) dapper universe

# deb [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-src [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse

# deb [http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu](http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) dapper-security universe
# deb-src [http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu](http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) dapper-security universe
```

So that it simply looks like this:
```
deb [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) dapper universe
deb-src [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) dapper universe

deb [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) dapper-backports main restricted universe multiverse

deb [http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu](http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) dapper-security universe
deb-src [http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu](http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) dapper-security universe
```

And then try searching for it again.
