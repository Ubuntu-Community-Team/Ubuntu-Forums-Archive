### Post by RudolfMDLT on 2007-09-29
Hi there,

I have an Ubuntu machine running samba as my backup pc. Every now and then I get odd errors, such as when I try to delete old backup files I get prompted for a username and password. And today - when I tried to copy files over the network using Konqueror, I get prompted whether i want to overwrite and exsisting folder(which doesn't yet exsist) - whether I click skip or overwrite, I get an error saying that Konqueror cannot enter a given folder?

Using SCP works - but I login with root access on the machine? could this be a problem? 

Is there anything wrong in my smb.conf file on the server?

Any help will greatly be appreciated!

```

#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which
# are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash)
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentary and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic
# errors.
#

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
workgroup = HOMENET

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
;   wins support = no

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
dns proxy = no

# What naming service and in what order should we use to resolve host names
# to IP addresses
;   name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast

#### Networking ####

# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
;   bind interfaces only = true



#### Debugging/Accounting ####

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

# Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
max log size = 1000

# If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
# parameter to 'yes'.
;   syslog only = no

# We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
# should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log
# through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
syslog = 0

# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d


####### Authentication #######

# "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
# in this server for every user accessing the server. See
# /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/ServerType.html
# in the samba-doc package for details.
  security = share

# You may wish to use password encryption.  See the section on
# 'encrypt passwords' in the smb.conf(5) manpage before enabling.
encrypt passwords = true

# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.
passdb backend = tdbsam

;   invalid users = root

# This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.
;   unix password sync = no

# For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
# parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan <<kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> for
# sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).
passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
passwd chat = *Enter\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\sUNIX\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

# This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
# when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
# 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.
;   pam password change = no

########## Domains ###########

# must have this setting enabled. If you are the BDC you must
# change the 'domain master' setting to no
#
;   domain logons = yes

# It specifies the location of a user's home directory (from the client
# point of view)
;   logon drive = H:
;   logon home = \\%N\%U

# The following setting only takes effect if 'domain logons' is set
# It specifies the script to run during logon. The script must be stored
# in the [netlogon] share
# NOTE: Must be store in 'DOS' file format convention
;   logon script = logon.cmd

# This allows Unix users to be created on the domain controller via the SAMR
# RPC pipe.  The example command creates a user account with a disabled Unix
# password; please adapt to your needs
; add user script = /usr/sbin/adduser --quiet --disabled-password --gecos "" %u

########## Printing ##########

# If you want to automatically load your printer list rather
# than setting them up individually then you'll need this
;   load printers = yes

# lpr(ng) printing. You may wish to override the location of the
# printcap file

# also give this right to other users to add drivers and set printer
# properties

These 0 reply threads are becoming common place! Mmmmmmm conspiracy I wonder... :P

Anyway - Just a question,  When I copy files from any machine, Windows and Linux to my Ubuntu server, is there a way to setup the samba  config file so that all files are 777 chmod'ed? Last night I  just chmod 777 -R the entire drive and now I can backup and delete in peace. Is there any way to make all files copied, "read and writeable for all"?

Thanks for any replies! :)

Rudolf

And you are logging in as root?

I assume this is a mixed-environment lan? I can't see any reason to run samba in the absence of windows.

I assume this is a mixed-environment lan? I can't see any reason to run samba in the absence of windows.

Yes it is - This Ubuntu machine is a backup server for all the pc's and laptops in the house.

No - I changed that(invalid user = root) parameter just before I thought of chmod-ing everything to  777. I don't have to log in at all. I just point my pc to smb://10.0.0.50 and I'm in my backup folder on the backup pc, there is no login request. 

When you come in from a windows box, and want to delete old backed up data, you get a Permissions error. When you come in from a linux box and want to delete old files, you get presented with a login dialog. Thats why I changed the root parameter, though I never used it, and I have again commented it out  last night. I'll change it now on the first post.

Any idea how to get rid of the windows errors and the Linux login boxes? 

thanks for the reply!

EDIT: I don't mind using scp and ssh - though it is a pain in the neck not to be able to use a gui. but I really need to be able to give these windows users the ability to create and delete as much as they want!?

EDIT: I have now added the following lines to the share:

available = yes
browseable = yes
public = yes
writable = yes  

As an attempt to get things going. I'll give this config a chance and see what happens.
