as u can see the resolutions in this config file go way higher than 1280x1024 so i`m wondering what it is i have to do to change this. sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg isnt an option as when i do that, yes i get the resoltions i want but then i lose proper video playback capabilities for some reason. something to do with the nvidia drivers.


any help would be greatly appreciated, thx
