When opening the Synaptics Package manager I get this error:

I say it's weird because it never came up before and everything seems to be working fine despite the error message. What shall I do?

*edit* Ignore me, I seemed to have fixed it. Sorry.

Don't forget to post your solutions when you fix things.  The next person who comes along with the problem will be very pleased you did.

I'm pretty sure I know what the answer is though.  I would say you just had to press the 'Reload' button to update the package list. :)
