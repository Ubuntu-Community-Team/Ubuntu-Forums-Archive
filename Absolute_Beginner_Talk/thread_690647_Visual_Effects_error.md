ok well i installed compiz on my laptop (Compaq nc4400) and tryed chaging it to custom under the visual effects and i get this error

Desktop effects could not be enabled.

so i go to the terminal and type Compiz and get this (I added the SKIP_CHECKS="yes" to the script that is executed when you type compiz) This is what comes up.

```
insane@insane-laptop:~$ compiz
Checking for Xgl: not present. 
No whitelisted driver found
SKIP_CHECKS is yes, so continuing despite problems.
Checking for texture_from_pixmap: present. 
Checking for non power of two support: present. 
Checking for Composite extension: present.

Checking for FBConfig: present. 
Checking for Xgl: not present.

insane@insane-laptop:~$ 

```

My graphics card is an embedded Intel 195gm.
I also installed XServer-XGL
Can anyone help?

EDIT: My os is 7.10 Gusty Gibbon

did you reboot after installing xserver-xgl?

and did you select the xclient session during the login ?

---

### Post by InsaneHL on 2008-02-07
Yes i did. i even did it again. I have no clue whats wrong.

Try without xserver-xgl

How do i make it so it doesn't use it?

Would it help if I installed my Graphics drivers? 

I cant find them because im on linux and im pretty sure there are only windows drivers for my chip.

### Post by spiderbatdad on 2008-02-07
i'm thinking ```
sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules
``` to see if a driver presents itself in the restricted driver manager. Not sure...there are some other xserver-radeon drivers listed as well that may help debug the thing. The graphics card you listed, I don't find on the compaq site. They have a 950 for the 945 chipset.

Yeah there were 2 Drivers there i have a 945gm, im goggling right as i type. I will edit my post if i find it.

OK i found it but it wouldn't install. The package was in the wrong format (it was an RPM)

Also did the restricted drivers and it did nothing.
