after what I have understood, apt-get update is downloading a list over everything located in a repository. So when you type apt-get install "application"
apt-get is reading its cache(the list of all files avaliable) and if it finds it. Then it knows where to download.

if you don't want to use the Search function in synaptic. Then type
apt-cache search "aplication name"


Please correct me if I'm wrong
