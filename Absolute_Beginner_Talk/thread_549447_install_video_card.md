i don't think you can use desktop effects with via. and i don't think via is stock. i think it puts the vesa driver in xorg.conf. either that or the dummy driver. i had via unichrome as well and just bought a nvidia card. it was too much hassle to deal with via. hahaha.

maybe some ninja can help.but i think not with via.
