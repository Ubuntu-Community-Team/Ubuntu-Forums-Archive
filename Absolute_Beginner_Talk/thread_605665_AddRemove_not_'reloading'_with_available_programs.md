title: "Add/Remove not 'reloading' with available programs"

Hi,

I am trying to install a program via Add/remove programs (Firestarter, but all are doing the same),  when I check the tick box for the program it says:-

> The list of applications is not availabe

Click on 'Reload' to load it. To reload the list you need a working Internet connection. 


I click Refresh on the pop up window and it does update, I see the download progress bar moving but it just keeps doing the same - saying the above.

Any ideas please?

Many thanks!

Can you post your /etc/apt/sources.list?

Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
```
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```

There is your problem!  You don't have any repos except the install CD!  So, edit /etc/apt/sources.list

```
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```
and place a # in front of the first line, cdrom, to comment it out.  Then, remove the # in front of all the lines that start with deb and deb-src.

Save it and run

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install firestarter
```

I know this is quite an old topic but after having this problem I came across this thread, have tried the solution but after typing "sudo apt-get install firestarter", it eventually just gets to "99% [waiting for headers]".

Can anyone help?
