Hi, I have read some other threads about this but i am completely new to ubuntu so some step by step help is needed.

Now I have installed ubuntu the wireless button when pressed no longer lights up and so i cannot get my wireless to turn on.

Any help would be much appreciated.

As i said i am a total beginner.

Thanks

alright.  This will take a bit of research--and you'll have to learn quite a bit to get this to work right.  But I'll help.

To get started, Go to Applications->Accessories->terminal, and from there type in:

```
lspci
```

Find something that says "Network controller" and then paste the results here.
