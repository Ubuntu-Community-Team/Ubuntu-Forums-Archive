With all the problems and unstability with 7.10, will they have to upgrade and release a new 7.10 (as a 7.15 or something) or will they just leave it up to us and wait for Hardy Heron?

First, when I'm installing Gutsy it says I have an error and cant use secure Ubuntu repositories.

In that case, just post your /etc/apt/sources.list here then.

```
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```

All your sources are commented out.  Uncommenting them (removing the '#' from the beginning of the line) will fix your problem :)

I've been seeing this a lot with problematic Gutsy upgrades.  Was this caused by users trying to upgrade while the servers were swamped?

Are you on the livecd TRYING to install, or have you already installed? If it's the latter you can go to SYSTEM | Administration | Software Sources and checkmark all of the repositories. Close that, open Synaptic and choose reload.
