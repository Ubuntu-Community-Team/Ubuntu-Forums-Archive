I had sound before the install with Knoppix so I know the hardware is working fine.My volume is all the way up on my desktop and the speakers. Even test sounds from the menu don't play. Here is what lspci is showing:

I had a setting wrong in the alsamixer and now I have sound. But the quality is poor. Compared to the sounds I got from XP. What can I go to improve the sound quality
