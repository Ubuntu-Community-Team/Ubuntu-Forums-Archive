When I open a terminal and type "compiz --replace", I get a mess, and it doesn't do what I ask. Here is what it says:

```

/usr/bin/compiz.real (core) - Error: no 'core' plugin with ABI version '20070917' loaded

/usr/bin/compiz.real (atlantis) - Error: InitObject failed
/usr/bin/compiz.real (core) - Error: Couldn't activate plugin 'atlantis'
GConf backend: There is an unsupported value at path /apps/compiz/plugins/scale/allscreens/options/initiate_edge. Settings from this path won't be read. Try to remove that value so that operation can continue properly.
```

What do I do?

Thank you in advance, as always!

Did  you try and install an unsupported plugin?  It looks like it is trying to load the atlantis plugin and that may be causing the problem.

I don't see anything called "atlantis" in Synaptic that I can un-check...

I am having the same problem! Only I'm not using compiz-fusion, just compiz, but I get the exact same errors in the terminal, and my machine ends up locking up, as my CPU usage goes through the roof.

What video card do you have and which video driver are you using?
