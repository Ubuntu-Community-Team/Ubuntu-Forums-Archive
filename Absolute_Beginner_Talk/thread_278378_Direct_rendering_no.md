Hey!

I don't get my graphic card working poreperly. I need to run DRI, but I don't get it "on". 

First of all, fglrx won't work on this card (too old for that). ATI has only their own drivers for card 8500 +. Some information:

Ati Radeon ViVo, 64 MB DDR, AGP (refered to R100 or 7200) 

$ glxinfo | grep rendering
direct rendering: No

$ glxinfo | grep Mesa
OpenGL vendor string: Mesa project: [www.mesa3d.org](www.mesa3d.org)
OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
OpenGL version string: 1.2 (1.5 Mesa 6.4.1)

$ fglrxinfo
display: :0.0  screen: 0
OpenGL vendor string: Mesa project: [www.mesa3d.org](www.mesa3d.org)
OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
OpenGL version string: 1.2 (1.5 Mesa 6.4.1)

$ xdriinfo
Screen 0: radeon

$ gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Checking this: [http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/ATI/Radeon7xxx](http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/ATI/Radeon7xxx)

If your card is indeed a 7xxx, then you should switch to the "radeon" driver. Not sure as to whether this will be a nice switch though sorry.

Thanks for that advice, but it didn't work:

I changed the driver in xorg.cong as **Driver "radeon"** and then rebooted the computer. Still the same "No direct redering"

$ xdriinfo
Screen 0: radeon

$ glxinfo | grep rendering
direct rendering: No
