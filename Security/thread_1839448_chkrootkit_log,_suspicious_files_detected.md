Hello all,

Sometimes my computer does weird, so i did a rootkit check with chkrootkit. But many file' s are not found and some suspicious files were found. Can you please check the output? Thanks in advance!

What I did,
I burnt a live cd (Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS).
I booted from this cd
Opened terminal:
$ sudo apt-get install chkrootkit
$ sudo chkrootkit -r /media/(DEVICECODE)/ > ~/chkrootkit-media2.txt
(I only scanned the partition where I installed kubuntu on, is this oke?)
After this was finished the file contained the following:
```

ROOTDIR is `/media/(DEVICECODE)/

These types of threads come up so often, in this sub-forum, that I'm thinking about moving them to Recurring Discussions.
