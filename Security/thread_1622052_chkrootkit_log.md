I had the same thing in my log.  Here was what was added to help me.  I have not looked into it more yet though.[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1621094](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1621094)
I have read up on the security stickies, but I have to dig a little bit more to see about these items that I have in common with you.  Maybe I will look tonight unless someone else has more insight.

A computer running slower is not necessarily a sign of some kind of infection, at least not in Ubuntu.

From the section on chkrootkit written by bodhi.zazen:
> As with all these tools false positives are common, use Google to search for suspicious results.
[http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9265639&postcount=7](http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9265639&postcount=7)

I do not see anything in the results that should be a cause of concern.

If you are experiencing slowdowns, I recommend you start a thread in General Help and post information such as the computer specifications, which version of Ubuntu, and perhaps details from logs like dmesg and kern.log
