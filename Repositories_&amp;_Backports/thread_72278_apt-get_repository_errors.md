Greetings!

I love Ubunutu and my problem is probably an easy fix, but I cannot seem to find the solution anywhere.

When I run the Synaptic Package Manager, I get the following errors upon loading the application (before I even try to install anything):

blakken - 
I clicked on the link that had the problem and this message was on the page:

You MUST use a mirror!
Access to our main server has been DENIED to the general public because it took simply AGES to sync to our mirrors. Please select one of our mirrors. Thanks!

Is there a way to reconfiger synaptic?
