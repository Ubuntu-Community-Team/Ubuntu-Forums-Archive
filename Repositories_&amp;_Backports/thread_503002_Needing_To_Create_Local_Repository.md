Good day to you all.

I am currently using WinXP with an AMD64 architecture.  I am in transition, and wish to download all of the existing AMD64 deb packages from all domains that offer them as you would through Ubuntu.  I am using an WinXP program called Wget.  What I need are the simple HTTP addressess for all three Ubuntu repositories.  I have perused the forums for the past few days, and notice (obviously) that there are Ubuntu-specific methods to downloading and configuring deb packages.  I need to do some downloading using my existing WinXP box and simply transfer the deb packages over and then point things locally when updating.

Thanks!
