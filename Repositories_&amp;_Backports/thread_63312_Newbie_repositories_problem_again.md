### Post by Dafydd on 2005-09-07
Hello everybody,

This is my first real go at Linux and I want to be able to use it for work (I'm a radio journalist and work on a Sony PCG machine).

But my problem today - after reinstalling Ubuntu due to my own silly experiment with Puppy Linux - is that none of the repositories work like they did yesterday. They all work fine - the same ones - on my Dell desktop machine, but none of them works on the Sony portable. Why? 

I really want to get rid of Windows and am almost there but...

Can anyone help?

Thanks a million 
best

Your repository list is actually located in /etc/apt/sources.list
What you attached appears more like the output of an apt-get update with a broken internet connection.  Are you able to hit the net from this machine?

 Hello,
Thanks for your speedy reply. Here's my sources.list below. I just followed the intructions at ubuntuguides.org. Everything worked fine at least a dozen times on the same machine, but today?  I can access the net from the same machine but can't use synaptic or apt-get any programs...
Thanks for any help
Dafydd

This looks fine to me.  Maybe the US repository servers are just down.

 Hi Steve,
No, it can't be the servers as I'm using exactly the same repositories to download ubuntu packages for my other machine (a Dell Dimension). And besides everything worked fine yesterday. I just don't understand. All I've done is completely reinstall Ubuntu... Please help! I need to get my portable machine working as I want to use it for work next week...
Best

The repos are working for me as well.  One suggestion (won't be the soultion), comment out the cdrom line of your repo...I don't think you need this after default install.

Are you able to ping the servers?
