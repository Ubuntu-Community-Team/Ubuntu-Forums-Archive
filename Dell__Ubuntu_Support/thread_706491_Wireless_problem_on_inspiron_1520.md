I just installed ubuntu 7.10 on my new dell inspiron 1520. Wireless networks aren't showing up anymore (most importantly my own). In other posts, I wan't able to find a suitable solution, but many asked to start off by running lspci, so I've included that below. Thank you for any help!

Can you see your card in Network Preferences, but just not any networks?
