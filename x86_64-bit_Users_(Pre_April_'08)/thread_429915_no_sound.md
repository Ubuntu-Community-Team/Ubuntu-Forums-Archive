Envy is designed for graphics drivers, yes. Have you confirmed that your soundcard is supported? You can check out the [ALSA page]("http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/") to search for your specific card.

In general, please post more about your situation. You haven't mentioned anything about your soundcard, which would be more pertinent information than your graphics one. =)

yes ... the output of the "lspci" command as well as "lsmod | grep snd" would be nice if you're not sure about your card.
