what command are you issuing?

Also, can you issue the following command in a terminal and post all the output?
```
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```

have you tried running 
```
sudo apt-get update
```
or pressing the reload button in synaptic.

I have run that a few times, and it gives me there errors that ran in my original post...

ok you need to comment out a few lines.

to do this open the /etc/apt/sources.list file. you can do this by running the command
```
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
```

comment out means to put a # on the front of the line to turn it into a 'comment' the line will then be ignored.

comment out
* the top line about the cdrom
* the bottom two lines about the universe (the line is already there in the middle)

now save that and run
```
sudo apt-get update
```
again.

can you connect to the internet on this machine?
