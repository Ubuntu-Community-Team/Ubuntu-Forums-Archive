I'm having a PS/2 mouse from compaq. I'm using Ubuntu Edgy Eft with kernel 2.6.17-11-generic. My X.org definitions are:
> 
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"
        Option          "Protocol"              "ExplorerPS/2"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"
        Option          "Emulate3Buttons"       "true"
EndSection

Every once in a while my mouse erratically moves, clicking random spots on the screen and is in general uncontrollable. The erratic behavior happens once in about half an hour. Otherwise the mouse functions normally.
On XP the mouse works fine, and there are no problem whatsoever. Meaning this is not a hardware issue.
Does anyone know this phenomena, or a cure for this?
