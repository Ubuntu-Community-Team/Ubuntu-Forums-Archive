Now, I haven't tried actually changing my resolution in the resolution change option under preferences, but whenever I run any full screen program (or game) that switches the resolution my computer crashes and X restarts. I tested the problem out several times by changing the resolution on the Battle of Wesnoth game, and no matter what I do, it always crashes when either it goes full screen or I change the resolution at full screen. 

I have a gateway MX6629 Notebook with an onboard "Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 900" (which is also supposed to support OpenGL, and I can't make that work either.).

Here is my xorg output:

I hope someone can help me out. (Fixing the OpenGL problem as well would be great.) :(
