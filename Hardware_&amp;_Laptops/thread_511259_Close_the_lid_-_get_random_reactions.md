One of those little yet greatly annoying things.
I'm running  Ubuntu 7.04 and it reacts randomly to the lid of my laptop being closed, that is it either asks me for password when I open it, or it doesn't at all. I failed to find any logic in this. Sometimes it locks up sometimes it doesn't. 

Here's my /etc/acpi/lid.sh:
```
#!/bin/bash

. /usr/share/acpi-support/power-funcs
. /usr/share/acpi-support/policy-funcs
. /etc/default/acpi-support

[ -x /etc/acpi/local/lid.sh.pre ] && /etc/acpi/local/lid.sh.pre

if [ `CheckPolicy` == 0 ]; then exit; fi

grep -q closed /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state
if [ $? = 0 ]
then
    for x in /tmp/.X11-unix/*; do
	displaynum=`echo $x | sed s#/tmp/.X11-unix/X##`
	getXuser;
	if [ x"$XAUTHORITY" != x"" ]; then
	    export DISPLAY=":$displaynum"	    
	    . /usr/share/acpi-support/screenblank
	fi
    done
else
    for x in /tmp/.X11-unix/*; do
	displaynum=`echo $x | sed s#/tmp/.X11-unix/X##`
	getXuser;
	if [ x"$XAUTHORITY" != x"" ]; then
	    export DISPLAY=":$displaynum"
	    grep -q off-line /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/*/state
	    if [ $? = 1 ]
		then
		if pidof xscreensaver > /dev/null; then 
		    su $user -c "xscreensaver-command -unthrottle"
		fi
	    fi
	    if [ x$RADEON_LIGHT = xtrue ]; then
		[ -x /usr/sbin/radeontool ] && radeontool light on
	    fi
	    if [ `pidof xscreensaver` ]; then
		su $user -c "xscreensaver-command -deactivate"
	    fi
	    su $user -c "xset dpms force on"
	fi
    done
fi
[ -x /etc/acpi/local/lid.sh.post ] && /etc/acpi/local/lid.sh.post
```

I won't print the make of my laptop as it will tell you nothing, if there's some more particular hardware information I should provide here, please tell me how to obtain it.

Thanks in advance
