Hi there ive installed lm-sensors, but when i add the applet to the menu bar, it says "no sensors found"

so i tried sensors-detect in terminal:

```
~$ sudo sensors-detect
# sensors-detect revision 4609 (2007-07-14 09:28:39 -0700)

This program will help you determine which kernel modules you need
to load to use lm_sensors most effectively. It is generally safe
and recommended to accept the default answers to all questions,
unless you know what you're doing.

We can start with probing for (PCI) I2C or SMBus adapters.
Do you want to probe now? (YES/no): 
Probing for PCI bus adapters...
Sorry, no known PCI bus adapters found.

We will now try to load each adapter module in turn.
If you have undetectable or unsupported adapters, you can have them
scanned by manually loading the modules before running this script.

We are now going to do the I2C/SMBus adapter probings. Some chips may
be double detected; we choose the one with the highest confidence
value in that case.
If you found that the adapter hung after probing a certain address,
you can specify that address to remain unprobed.

Some chips are also accessible through the ISA I/O ports. We have to
write to arbitrary I/O ports to probe them. This is usually safe though.
Yes, you do have ISA I/O ports even if you do not have any ISA slots!
Do you want to scan the ISA I/O ports? (YES/no): 
Probing for `National Semiconductor LM78' at 0x290...       No
Probing for `National Semiconductor LM78-J' at 0x290...     No
Probing for `National Semiconductor LM79' at 0x290...       No
Probing for `Winbond W83781D' at 0x290...                   No
Probing for `Winbond W83782D' at 0x290...                   No
Probing for `Silicon Integrated Systems SIS5595'...         No
Probing for `VIA VT82C686 Integrated Sensors'...            No
Probing for `VIA VT8231 Integrated Sensors'...              No
Probing for `IPMI BMC KCS' at 0xca0...                      No
Probing for `IPMI BMC SMIC' at 0xca8...                     No

Some Super I/O chips may also contain sensors. We have to write to
standard I/O ports to probe them. This is usually safe.
Do you want to scan for Super I/O sensors? (YES/no): 
Probing for Super-I/O at 0x2e/0x2f
Trying family `National Semiconductor'...                   No
Trying family `SMSC'...                                     No
Trying family `VIA/Winbond/Fintek'...                       Yes
Found `Winbond W83627EHF/EHG Super IO Sensors'              Success!
    (address 0x290, driver `w83627ehf')
Probing for Super-I/O at 0x4e/0x4f
Trying family `National Semiconductor'...                   No
Trying family `SMSC'...                                     No
Trying family `VIA/Winbond/Fintek'...                       No
Trying family `ITE'...                                      No

Some CPUs or memory controllers may also contain embedded sensors.
Do you want to scan for them? (YES/no): 
AMD K8 thermal sensors...                                   No
Intel Core family thermal sensor...                         No
Intel AMB FB-DIMM thermal sensor...                         No

Now follows a summary of the probes I have just done.
Just press ENTER to continue: 

Driver `w83627ehf' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * ISA bus, address 0x290
    Chip `Winbond W83627EHF/EHG Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 9)

I will now generate the commands needed to load the required modules.
Just press ENTER to continue: 

To make the sensors modules behave correctly, add these lines to
/etc/modules:

#----cut here----
# Chip drivers
w83627ehf
#----cut here----


Do you want to add these lines to /etc/modules automatically? (yes/NO)y

```

however it still does not recognize the cpu temp, i tried sudo apt-get install hddtemp, so now the lm-sensors applet now recognizes the hdd temp and displays on the menu bar, heres the preferences screenshot of my lm-sensors:
