Hi, 
I reinstalled nvidia-glx-new and restricted modules, which also came with a new kernel image 2.6.22-14-386 (was using 2.6.22-14-generic, there was sound.). I did this because I want to stop freezing my Ubuntu 7.10. Now freeze gone away and my system is stable, but with new kernel I don't have sound. I have error:
```
gconfaudiosrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink profile=chat: Could not open resource for writing.
```
I reinstall all sound modules: linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils, but this didn't help.

My  lspci:
