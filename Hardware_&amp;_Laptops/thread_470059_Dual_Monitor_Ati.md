Hey everyone,

Got round to re installing ubuntu and realised how great it is.

Got nearly everything working apart from both my monitors, spent nearly a full week trying to get these working now. I've read Zion's guide, the aticonfig commands go in fine but once i restart X my second monitor is just a clone with 'scope'

My main monitor is 1400 x 900 and the second 1024 x 768 and i'm using the fglrx drivers.

I don't particularity want to edit my Xorg.conf manually as I got dual monitor working from the command line last time using 'aticonfig --initial=dual-head --screen-layout=right' if I remember correctly.

Any ideas why Xorg seems to be ignoring my requests?

regards.
