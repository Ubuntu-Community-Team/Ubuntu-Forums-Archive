I have tried the automatic installation where I have just installed the drivers via double clicking on the install file and run as in terminal however it doesn't seem to be working.

I'm now trying to do the manual install and I'm not sure how exaclty we can turn on sound support via the soundcore module, how and where is the soundcore module and how do I turn it on.

So anybody any tips fo rme on how to install this stupid driver?

yeah i have just the same problem, without this driver i cant use my 5.1 system. i tried installing by the auto install but it didnt work

Down is the text found into the readme

```
Installation:
This Source Code is from www.alsa-project.org.
For driver installation, please follow below steps. 

Automatic install:
execute

  ./install

Manual install:
Step 1. unzip source code
        tar xfvj alsa-driver-1.0.xx.tar.bz2

Step 2. Turn on sound support (soundcore module, default turn on)

Step 3. Complied source code
	a. cd alsa-driver-1.0.xx
	b. ./configure
	c. make
	d. make install
	e. ./snddevices

Step 4. Edit your /etc/modules.conf or conf.modules depending on the distribution
 	(Please refer to the attached modules.conf)
	 
        snd-xxxx is the card ID.

               snd-hda-intel
           --- ATI chipset -----
	       snd-atiixp

        -- AC97 controller --ALC655 ALC650 ALC250 ALC255
           --- Intel ICH6 ICH7 , SiS 7012 and NVidia----------

	       snd-via82xx
           --- ATI Chipset  -------------------------------
	       snd-atiixp

        Copy and paste this to the bottom of your /etc/modules.conf or /etc/modprobe.conf file.
	# ALSA portion
          alias char-major-116 snd
          alias snd-card-0 snd-xxxx     
        # OSS/Free portion
          alias char-major-14 soundcore
          alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
        # card #1
          alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
          alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
          alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
          alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
          alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss

Step 5. reboot your machine

Step 6. Use the alsamixer the disable mute (All audio line default is mute)
        *Must to compile and to install the ALSA library and utility. (Use automatic install is already install)
        excute alsamixer

Note: 	1. The most detail information, can refer the alsa-kernel/Documenttation/ALSA-Configuration.txt in the azx-021705.tar.bz2.
	2. Kernel Version must be 2.2.14 or later.
	3. All mixer channels are muted by default. You must use a native
		or OSS mixer program to unmute appropriate channels.
	4. If can not compile the source code, try to rename the /usr/src/linux-2.x -> /usr/src/linux.
	5. The driver added to support the SPDIF functoin. 	
	6. a. You can download the alsa-lib-1.0.9 and alsa-utils-1.0.9a form the www.alsa-project.org, then unzip and install them. 
	   b. Suggest use "alsamixer" to control mixer function.
	   c. Used "alsaconf" can autodetect which drive you need to install (step 4). 	
        7. SUSE Distribution must install the ncurses package. 
```

some help would be REALLY appreciated.

thanks~
