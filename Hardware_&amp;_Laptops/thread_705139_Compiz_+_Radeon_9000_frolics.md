Hi, I have been pootling around in the posts previously dealing with thsi issue, but still needed to make this post as the others weren't quite hitting the spot.

I am running gutsy on a dell latitude D600 with a rv250 Radeon FireGL 9000 which is a 32 meg affair. 

I have also installed the open source driver as the restricted one was...well, restricting. 

But I cannot run compiz at any resolution other than 1024 768, which is a virtual setting in my xorg.config which looks like this:

And compiz --return gives out this

> ~$ compiz --return
Checking for Xgl: not present. 
Detected PCI ID for VGA: 01:00.0 0300: 1002:4c66 (rev 02) (prog-if 00 [VGA])

Trying again with indirect rendering:

I am so close...so close to getting it sorted but this last hurdle has me stumped. All I want is to run compiz at 1400 1050! Thanks to anyone who can help!
