Every time I run apt-get update I get this message:

W: Couldn't stat source package list [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com) hoary/restricted Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_hoary_restricte d_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
W: Couldn't stat source package list [http://security.ubuntu.com](http://security.ubuntu.com) hoary-security/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/security.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_hoary-security_universe_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
W: Couldn't stat source package list [http://us.archive.ubuntu.com](http://us.archive.ubuntu.com) hoary/restricted Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_hoary_restricte d_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
W: Couldn't stat source package list [http://security.ubuntu.com](http://security.ubuntu.com) hoary-security/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/security.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_hoary-security_universe_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)


It then says:

W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems


But this problem happens every time I run apt-get update. Does anybody know what this problem is or how to fix it?

If you are getting these messages while doing an 'apt-get update' then it means apt is not able to connect or pull from some of the repos in your sources.list. This could be caused by many things, but the most likely reason is that the repos are under maintenance and are temporarily unavailable.

Is there an error in it?

I'm not saying there is an error in your sources.list. Obviously, if you have been using them with no other such problems then there is nothing to worry about. The most likely scenario is that some of the mirrors are undergoing maintenance and will be back up shortly.

If you would like to try my list you are welcome to do so.
