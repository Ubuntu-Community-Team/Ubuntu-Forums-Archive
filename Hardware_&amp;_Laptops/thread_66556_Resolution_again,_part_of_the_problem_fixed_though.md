That problem I had before was that I was running Breezy Badger and hade some problems installing the Nvidia drivers. Now I've installed Hoary together with the Nvidia drivers, and it works pretty good. Now my question is how I force the drivers to use a certain resolution that isn't (officially) supported by the screen, 1280x960 @ 72 Hz. I know that it works since I'm using that resolution in Windows (by unchecking the "Hide unsupported resolutions" checkbox in advanced settings), but how do I do it in windows? I've added the res. to the xorg.conf file and set the refresh rate higher than 72 Hz, but I can't select it in the settings in Gnome.

up the sync & refresh to the settings for your monitor
it maybe worth while checking the manual for your monitor on the makers web site ...

I tried it, now I can select 1280x960 but only at 60 Hz, giving me a headache..
