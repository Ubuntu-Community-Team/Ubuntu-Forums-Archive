Hey guys!

I recently installed Ubuntu through Wubi on my Averatec 5400 Series laptop. I'm interested in knowing what are the drivers I should use for optimum performance and setup before I install it  completely on a second partition here. Of course, I'm hoping for 3D Acceleration (UT2004, CS1.6 and GunBound work on Windows with D3D and OpenGL acceleration), DVD playback and wireless support.

Here's my LSPCI in case it helps:
