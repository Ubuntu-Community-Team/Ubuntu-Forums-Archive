Hi folks, 

I'm facing a very usual problem: I can hear everything but microphone doesn't work at all. 
I read [this posts]("http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=506515") but it's  a bit different. So, thanks for any help. 

I'm using Gnome Sound Recorder and Skype (testing call) to try it. 

Here are the outputs:
