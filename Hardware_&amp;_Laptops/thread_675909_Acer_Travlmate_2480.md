Hi,
I just installed Gutsy on my girlfriends' Acer Travelmate 2480. There seems to be something maxing out the processor activity in the panel graph. I have the colorscheme set to show IO Wait time in red, and every couple minutes, the graph turns totally red and stays that way for as long as ten minutes.

There is some error messages when she boots up. They go too fast for me to write down or even to see, but I think it was something about IRQs or some such thing. It then scrolls a list of hardware addresses (memory, maybe) and says "Problem will not be fixed."

This comp only has 512MB of memory, but should be plenty to run Gutsy.I have a rather large swapfile set up, just in case it isn't enough.

I can't say it's tied to any one application or any particular set of circumstances, it just seems to happen whenever.

If I can provide any further info, just let me know.
