Hi there.

I've looked through many threads that covered the same problem and I attempted some of the remedies that they prescribed.  I installed the new driver for my Intel 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device, I installed the 915 resolution package, and I edited the .xorg file.  I still can't get 1280x1024 as a resolution option.  If anyone can help I would appreciate it immensely. 

Here is my xorg.conf.  Is there an easier way to post it besides copying and pasting?
