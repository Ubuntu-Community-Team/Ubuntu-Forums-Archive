I've installed the new Ubuntu 7.10 (the 7.04 gives me some errors).
All the hardware works except the modem.
Windows says it's a Motorola Sm56 but on linux scanmodem says me that the modem is the intel audio. On windows the modem il located in Percorso 65535 (Internal High Definition Audio Bus. Does anybody solved the problem?

I've tried with all the sm56k procedure but no one works... Kppp tells me "unable to open modem" in the modem query....
