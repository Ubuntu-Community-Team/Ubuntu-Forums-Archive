I tried following some instructions I found from the net and the forums, but I've had no luck getting my nVidia driver installation to work. I then tried to do it myself, and still no luck. I'm pretty new at all this, so bear with me :)

Can anyone help me out? Here are some details...
My video card is a GeForce 2, so that means I need the nvidia-glx-legacy drivers.

I'm trying to test if it works by typing: glxinfo | grep rendering
It should say yes or no, but instead for me it says:

IF I just type in glxinfo I get:

any ideas?

In an _old PC_ I have a _nvidia card which needs "nvidia-glx-legacy"_, too and I had to _disable the COMPOSITE_ extension to have a working GLX extension. I had to put the following lines at the end of my xorg.conf file:
```

Section "Extensions"
 Option "Composite" "Disable"
EndSection

```

COMPOSITE seems to be enabled by default in these days ...
