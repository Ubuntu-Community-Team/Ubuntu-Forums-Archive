HI!

It seems like ubuntu edgy doesn't detect my sound card correctly. In volume control i have no alsa device option, only oss. At boot up sound comes from only one speaker, but after i mute and unmute volume then both speakers work. I'm also having problems with skype: it says /dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
