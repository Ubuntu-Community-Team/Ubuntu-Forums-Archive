Hi,

I'm having problems to burn CDs on my IBM T42 laptop which runs dapper. I guess the problem has existed already since the update, but I just recently became aware of it.

The system is as mentioned above a up-to-date dapper with a self-compiled kernel (2.6.17.4), but the problem exists as well with the standard dapper kernel.

If I try to burn with k3b the ISO-image of Ubuntu dapper I get the following debugging output
