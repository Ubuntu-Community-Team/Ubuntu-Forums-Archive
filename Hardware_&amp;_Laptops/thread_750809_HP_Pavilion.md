Well, where to start. My sound card isn't detected, I enabled the restricted drivers, but I can't put resolution higher than 640x480, my wireless NIC isn't detected, there's more, but I'd like to get these ones resolved first.

Since you have an wireless-n card, you should try ndiswrapper first.  The bcm43xx/b43 drivers currently don't support the 4328 chipset yet.
