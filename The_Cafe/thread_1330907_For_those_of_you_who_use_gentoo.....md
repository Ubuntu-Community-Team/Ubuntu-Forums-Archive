How has it worked out for you? Was the many hours of configuring and compiling worth it? I'm installing it now. Rather I have been for a while now. I need to get my kernel compiled correctly AMD64 is getting on my nerves. So the only thing I can do is wait for a reply on their forums. In the meantime, genkernel should work. Cya later!

I just installed Gentoo last weekend, I have a hyper thread intel that plays nice with 64 bit apps, so I run the AMD64 kernel myself.  I have not been impressed, though with SO many options, i'm sure i've done something wrong.  :)  The first install I did was with the genkernel, and I couldn't get X running so I tried again compiling my own kernel.  (X failed because I didn't realize I didn't have HAL or anything running)  Neither seem very fast, sure the home made kernel is smaller in size, but that's about the only difference I can see.  I wanted to squeak some extra performance out of my pc, and heard Gentoo was the fastest.  I also installed an Ubuntu 9.10 server and put a gui on it (icewm) and it runs about 1.5 times faster than the comparable icewm Gentoo.  All my OSes (except XP) are 64 bit.

In short, it seems like it has real power, but *i'll* probably never harness it. Also, compiling every single thing with emerge is somewhat tedious, and very time consuming.  But here's hoping you have better luck than me! :)

I used gentoo a long time before arch, I don't think it's worth it there is no noticeable speed increase and compiling always breaks then you google and fix it. It gets tiresome arch is much better for me i think. That's not to say I might not reinstall gentoo...I'm a constant distro hopper (its an addiction) lol

I've used Gentoo but found Crux more to my liking because it seemed far more simple, and coming from an Arch background it was similar to what I was used to.

I can't say that I got any fantastical speed improvements with Gentoo because to be honest, I didn't spend enough time with it. Speaking for Crux though, it's a considerable improvment over the speed that Arch gives. And it scales well to hardware demands, so I can use it on extremely outdated machines without sacrificing function.

I only mention those things because Gentoo and Crux are both source-based, which is what I prefer any more. Okay, I'll be quiet now. ... :oops:

The amount of time you lose with a whole lifetime of things running slower and unoptimized in Ubuntu is less than the amount of time you spend compiling and setting up everything in Gentoo.

A lot of people have asked this question lately in the LQ forum, even got some emails. [Here]("http://pdg86.wordpress.com/2009/11/18/rant-arch-or-gentoo/") is my opinion.

EDIT: before you complain that you didn't ask for a comparison, just ignore the comparison part and read the gentoo part. 

Regards

Don't use Gentoo. Best advice you'll ever get. Use Arch or something.

Why. The fun is in the src! Emerge FTW!

I wanna see you come here after a month and say the same thing. :p

I tried it about 3 years ago merely to throw myself in the deep end to learn the inner workings of Linux. Gentoo is probably one of the best distros if you *really* want to jump headlong into being a "power user" so to speak.
It can be quite snappy in comparison to other distros if you set it up correctly, but there is a huge amount of time and patience required to compile pretty much everything from source.

Gentoo is a lot of fun IMO, but I think it's a classical example of a hobbyist's distro. I wouldn't use it for any other reason really.

No.  I was on Gentoo for nearly three years.  Something would break and I never knew if it was a kernel option I hadn't selected, a kernel option I shouldn't have selected, a module I should have compiled into the kernel, a compiled driver I should have left a module, a bug in an application, something else and so on.  The Gentoo community is great and I always found the solution after some digging but quite frankly, I want my OS to support my applications, not be a project onto its own.
I'm much happier with Ubuntu.

gentoo only meaningful if support AUTOMATIC build system AND
when build process finished, Notify the result to user AND
replace the current system which user using.

like DNA double helix.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)
BUT then i prefer CLFS over gentoo

It's actually for people like you that Gentoo gets lots of criticism of it not being 'worth it'.


Just "Installing" the distro is not an option so if you're using Genkernel, do not use Gentoo...Gentoo is about customization so you need to go through each and every kernel option check what help has to say, and then do what you think.

Before you actually install the distro I'm telling you before hand, if you do not find significant difference in speeds of Ubutnu and Gentoo it's not Gentoo's fault...it's yours, you did not configure you system well; here is my make.conf - 

```

And it will not work for you...it should not...why? Cause it's optimized for my purpose.

My Gentoo is almost twice as fast as Ubuntu and when it comes to performance...Ubuntu is ****...and worst when considering dependency handling with customization.

[QUOTE=mrtomservo]I just installed Gentoo last weekend, I have a hyper thread intel that plays nice with 64 bit apps, so I run the AMD64 kernel myself.[/QUOTE]

So how do you know your amd64 Kernel will be nice for you?...how did you configure you kernel specific to your intel?

> (X failed because I didn't realize I didn't have HAL or anything running)

Here we go...dude Gentoo is for people who like to read and learn...it's written in xfce-how that you need to emerge hal before installing how could you have missed it?

Also post your make.conf

[QUOTE=forrestcupp]The amount of time you lose with a whole lifetime of things running slower and unoptimized in Ubuntu is less than the amount of time you spend compiling and setting up everything in Gentoo.[/QUOTE]

So why sit and watch the compilation process? why not - 

emerge --quiet

??


Over all I bet ALL the people here complaining Gentoo is not worth it have their make.conf empty and use Genkernel...so WHY is it that I find Gentoo twice as fast as Ubutnu?...placebo effect?...that make things twice as fast?

Probably wishful thinking.  Do you have benchmarks to prove it is actually *twice* as fast? I'd like to see them. I have a hard time believing it.  
For me, the price/performance ratio is just not there. Ubuntu runs fast enough for my purposes. My time is worth money.  For the amount of time-money I'd need to spend to get Gentoo twice as fast as Ubuntu (if that's even possible) I'd just buy faster hardware, run Ubuntu and call it a day.  And I'd get further ahead every time Gentoo releases something that breaks something else and requires hours of digging in the forums and futzing to get it to work again.

Not exactly twice but it feels very light and fast...and it's apparent, even I didn't expect such performance boosts.

I don't know but I find portage ok...it doesn't usually break.

Yes you have to run revdep-rebuild a few times...but it really doesn't take that much time.


Ok in here -

Actually I will try it with real benchmarks...real world benchmarks like firefox startup times, ktorrent startup times etc...

I just noticed something: you are using XFCE.  Are you comparing Gentoo and XFCE vs. Ubuntu and Gnome? That will be a big factor in responsiveness. XFCE is *way *lighter than Gnome.  Heck, plain XFCE is way lighter than Xubuntu because all the crap they do to tie it to Ubuntu.

There were some pretty spectacular failures back in the day.  I remember the last straw for me was an October 2006 update breaking X and K3B.

U can make gentoo the best and the fastest linux system ever, but ...  only if you have lots of spare time needed for compiling.

Yep. You can make LFS fast too. In fact. If you compile everything on any distro, it will be equally as fast.

### Post by Diluted on 2009-11-24
I remember reading on BSD and it is said that changing CFLAGS does not necessarily improve performance and in worst cases, it could even decrease it (or not compile at all). The reason given was that the upstream usually know which compiler switches to use to optimize their software. By changing the CFLAGS, you will potentially overwrite their switches. If you are sticking to a safe set of CFLAGS, then I'd guess the resulting binary would be less optimized than if you had left CFLAGS alone.

Now, I haven't used Gentoo for a while, but looking at dE_logics's make.conf, CFLAGS= and CXXFLAGS= are used. If I remember correctly (not too sure whether it would work differently in Linux), this would overwrite the default switches and use exactly the ones which the user has specified. I don't know if ebuilds have a default set of switches, so it may be worse to have empty CFLAGS.

So the question is, do you trust upstream, or your own extensive knowledge of programming and gcc?

I'm a long-time Gentoo user, and just registered now so I could comment on this thread.

Yes, you can break things with overly aggressive CFLAGS, but that's not to say they don't have their use. There is a large speed improvement between -march=generic and -march=core2 because you are telling the compiler that it is OK to use core2 specific instructions instead of just the base x86 stuff. The generated code won't run on a Pentium III, but that's OK because you are compiling for YOUR CPU, not a set of generic x86 CPUs. I don't for a minute believe that you'll see 50% speedups, but 10-15% is not unheard of. I've recently been playing with the Intel C++ Compiler on Gentoo (You can make emerge use icc for certain ebuilds, if you want) and have managed to increase my x264 encoding performance by over 20%, but that's a specific CPU-intensive case. 

Regarding your question about the upstream maintainers knowing best: If there is good reason to stick to a pre-defined set of compiler options, the ebuild (Gentoo's equivalent of a .deb) will specify that, and ignore your custom CFLAGS. (Although in most cases, you can override this with a USE flag, if you know what you are doing.)

Back to the OPs question:

Both Ubuntu and Gentoo are fine choices, but they are aimed at different users. If you want your computer to "just work" and are not willing to put the time and effort into reading the documentation, and learning how things really work, Ubuntu is the better choice. You can manage on an Ubuntu system without "resorting" to the command line, and without much knowledge of what goes on under the hood. It's a great Windows replacement, and is a great OS for people who are new to Linux, or people who just want to get work done.

Gentoo, on the other hand, is aimed at people who like to "tinker." It's basically Linux from Scratch with a bunch of tools to make it easier to manage. If you take the time to RTFM and learn how things work you will be rewarded with a fast, sleek, bleeding-edge Linux system that is fairly easy to manage. If you don't, you'll probably end up looking at a black screen with the words "panic vfs_mountroot cannot mount root" on it. ;)

I love Gentoo. It gives me all the power and flexibility I could possibly ask for. I don't have to wait for the distro developers to "bless" any new technology, and I can tweak and customize the system to my heart's content. But, I don't usually recommend people switch to it. I find myself recommending Ubuntu to people most of the time, because the experience is so much smoother for a casual user. 

So before making blanket statements like "Gentoo sucks." you should first decide if you are the target user or not. If you are happy using Ubuntu, and only thinking of going to Gentoo for the (minor) speed boost, you will not be happy with it and should abandon your plan to switch right now. If you are the kind of user who will happily upgrade your Xorg from source, and build your own kernel, and just wish it was easier to do those things on Ubuntu, I wholeheartedly recommend Gentoo. You'll love it. (I know I do.)

Oh, I almost forgot, Linux Magazine did some benchmarking of Gentoo with different CFLAGS, and used Ubuntu 9.04 as a control:

[http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7574/](http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7574/)

"Although we are not comparing apples to apples, Gentoo did out-perform Ubuntu in almost every test, and sometimes by a fair margin. It does appear that optimizing for a specific CPU can yield a decent performance increase."

The problem is that no one set of CFLAGS was optimal. Depending on the test -Os, -O2, and -O3 each won. You have to tinker with it to get the best performance. I've made things even worse by throwing 'icc' into the mix along with 'gcc' on my system, but I've tried to identify the sore spots (primarily codecs) and work on them one at a time, benchmarking the results with each tweak. 

Again, if this sounds like a fun way to waste an afternoon, I suggest you give Gentoo a whirl. If messing with compiler flags and benchmarking your results in order to shave 5 minutes off the time to encode a DVD sounds like hell, stick with Ubuntu. :D

I've just installed Ubuntu-9.10 after using Gentoo exclusively for the last 5 years, and i'm pleasantly surprised at how good it is, performance-wise. I fully expected a non-optimised, Gnome-based system with lots of undesired optional features enabled to be much less responsive - so kudos to you, Ubuntu-dev's! :P 

I'm sorry to say that in my opinion, Gentoo has been in steady decline ever since Daniel Robbins originally left the team (and yes, i've tried Funtoo). As well as the general lack of focused leadership, the QA on the ebuild-tree is not what it once was, and that's the foundation on which the whole system is built. :cry: 

I'd previously maintained 2 separately bootable Gentoo systems on different partitions of the same hard-drive, one for everyday use and another for experimentation. I've now replaced the experimentation one with Ubuntu, and once i've migrated everything i need over to it, i intend to replace the other with a different source-based alternative, possibly [Source Mage](http://www.sourcemage.org/), or just [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/), if i can find a package-management system that i'm happy to use with it (the ones from Crux and Arch both have shortcomings for what i want).

I'll freely admit that i've benefited greatly from using Gentoo, and know an awful lot more about Linux than i would if i'd been on a more *'user-friendly'* distro all this time, but now i'd rather use either Ubuntu, coz it "just works", or an LFS-variant, coz it's faster and more robust in my experience...

+1 to that, but if I want something really robust, I'd rather use RHEL... or not use Linux altogether. ;)

*shudders*

I have nothing but terrible memories for Gentoo. I have friends that use it, but it did not work out for me. A Slackware or Debian box would be my preference.

However, it's not a bad distro.

Just "Installing" the distro is not an option so if you're using Genkernel, do not use Gentoo...Gentoo is about customization so you need to go through each and every kernel option check what help has to say, and then do what you think.

Before you actually install the distro I'm telling you before hand, if you do not find significant difference in speeds of Ubutnu and Gentoo it's not Gentoo's fault...it's yours, you did not configure you system well; here is my make.conf -

And it will not work for you...it should not...why? Cause it's optimized for my purpose.

My Gentoo is almost twice as fast as Ubuntu and when it comes to performance...Ubuntu is ****...and worst when considering dependency handling with customization.



So how do you know your amd64 Kernel will be nice for you?...how did you configure you kernel specific to your intel?



Here we go...dude Gentoo is for people who like to read and learn...it's written in xfce-how that you need to emerge hal before installing how could you have missed it?

Also post your make.conf



So why sit and watch the compilation process? why not - 

emerge --quiet

??


Over all I bet ALL the people here complaining Gentoo is not worth it have their make.conf empty and use Genkernel...so WHY is it that I find Gentoo twice as fast as Ubutnu?...placebo effect?...that make things twice as fast?

Parallel-fetch and userfetch? Why? Why no -march=native? And it looks like you're not using portage profiles effectively, judging by how many USE flags you have.

I believe I saw your thread in the Gentoo forums. Didn't they tell you that those results are ubsubstantiated, and the main benefit of Gentoo is USE flags?

I don't understand why you continue to push the idea that Gentoo is some magical distro that makes your computer Jesse Owens on amphetamines. It's a good distro to tweak, sure, but twice as fast? *Really?*
