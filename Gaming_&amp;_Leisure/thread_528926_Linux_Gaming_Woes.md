Sorry for the noob post, but I'm getting a major headache here ](*,). I installed Ubuntu 6.10 yesterday after Windows refused to boot and I'm currently loving it. The only complaint I have is with gaming and using the terminal. :confused: My first problem is with Steam. I got it to update and all, but when I try to play the games (CS 1.6 and DOD 1.3) the menu will come up with no text and I can't exit it at all. I uninstalled it and tried again with steam_install.exe. Now it'll update to 26%, then the update window will exit and the pop back up and just stay at 0%. 

  My second problem is with Enemy Territory. I know to let it run as a an executable, but I ran into a problem  

*/root/.setup13377: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-1.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.* :confused:

Once again sorry for the noob post but I'm so used to Windows XP and I'll completely confused here.

Sorry to hear about that man. I don't feel like attempting Steam yet. I just started with Ubuntu a few days ago. I've been having gaming issues as well..... cept with Diablo 2. I'm hating the learning aspect of it right now, but it's just a matter of getting used to it.

Just wanted to say though if ya get steam going for those games you should play Natural Selection ; )

And good luck with your problem = P

did you get the tohtom font and put it in the font folder

also what video card are you using?

check if direct rendering is enabled by typing in a terminal      "glxinfo | grep render"           and it should say yes and if it doesnt you have to enable it some how im not sure how thought

Steam can be a bitch to install sometimes. Check [http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=1554](http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=1554) and see if anything helps.

As for Enemy Territory, the reason you're getting that error is because the installer needs some extra libraries that aren't installed by default. So, running the following in a terminal

sudo apt-get install libgtk1.2

will give you what you need to run the setup properly.

Thanks, I finally got ET running. My gfx card (if you can call it that) is an Mesa DRI Intel 865G 20050225 with Direct Rendering enabled. I'll try the steam install described on the WineHQ entry after dinner and see what happens. Thanks for the help. :)

If you still get the 26% update error after installing Steam, try running the fix described in the how-to like this:
```
nice -19 wine steamTmp.exe SelfUpdate "Steam.exe" 14
```
That was the only way it would work for me.

It updates fully now, but the games still crash. :mad:

What graphics card do you have and have you installed the 3D accelerated driver for it?

My gfx card (if you can call it that) is and Mesa DRI Intel 865G 200502 and I don't think I have.
