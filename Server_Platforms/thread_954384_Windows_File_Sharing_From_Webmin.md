title: "Windows File Sharing From Webmin"

### Post by Buntubailey on 2008-10-21
Hello,

I am trying to set up a new server in my small office, I have finally managed to setup a RAID5 array and install Ubuntu 8.04 server, I also installed openSSH, print server and Samba, I then installed Webmin to configure the whole thing. Now I am having problems though. I can set new folders and users on the unix side and the same on the samba side and I can see these folders from my windows machines but when I try to write to the folders I get the error about not having permission. I don't understand this as I have set the priveliges in samba through webmin to read and write for all users but it won't allow me to do so. I can open the folders from my windows machine but if I try to change anything it tells me I don't have permission. Can anybody shed any light on what settings I should be using through Webmin to create a shared drive (\\SERVER1).

Thanks,

Buntubailey

stay in touch,i'll send you a small tutorial that makes things easy...i managed samba in seconds! i think you have not set the right permissions to the users (777 i think...)...try to search in the samba set up for "user rights"...or something and set it to 777...............did you manage the dhcp server to give ip's to the clients? see ya soon!

Permissions waqs something I was concerned about, the server is connected to my router via DHCP and all the windows clients connect via DHCP, I found a page in webmin called file share defaults with the option of file permissions, I changed the unix file mode and unix directory mode to 777 but to no avail, I still can't add anything to the share or remove anything, hopefully your guide will put me on the right path.

Can you post the file /etc/samba/smb.conf here?

To make writeable shares, you have to make sure that both the Samba shares are set to "writeable" and the local file permissions allow for writing.   If Samba is set for user mode security, this means whatever user they log in as needs write permissions, and if you're using share mode the user that needs permissions is "nobody".

Or you can just make permissions 777 which means anyone and anything can write files.  

I think what you did in changing "unix file mode" and "unix directory mode" was to make the default permissions for newly created folders 777.  You have to go into the system itself and change the permissions on the existing folders before you can write to them.

I think I am going around in circles here and i'm not quite sure what is working and what is not, i've tried a few different combinations and it started working, the easiest way was to use the file manager utility of webmin and use the buttons for create new folder, and within that choose options and it has boxes for full read write access which changes it to 777, but I really need each of the users to log in with a username and password, so I tried lots of different things and it started working, for a bit and now I can't get my windows machine to access it again. So I deleted all the users and deleted all the shares and started again, and now I am back to square one. Here is the smb.conf file, hope you can help.

#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash) 
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentary and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors.

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server

#### Networking ####

# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.

#### Debugging/Accounting ####

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects

# Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).

# If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
# parameter to 'yes'.
;   syslog only = no

# We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
# should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log
# through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.

# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace


####### Authentication #######

# "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
# in this server for every user accessing the server. See
# /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/Samba3-HOWTO/ServerType.html
# in the samba-doc package for details.

# You may wish to use password encryption.  See the section on
# 'encrypt passwords' in the smb.conf(5) manpage before enabling.

# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.  


;   guest account = nobody

# This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.

# For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
# parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan <<kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> for
# sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).

# This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
# when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
# 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.

# This option controls how nsuccessful authentication attempts are mapped 
# to anonymous connections
