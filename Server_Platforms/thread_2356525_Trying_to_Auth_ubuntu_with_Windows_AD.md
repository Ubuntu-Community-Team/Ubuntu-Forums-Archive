Hi,

I'm having trouble trying to get my Ad users to auth with a ubuntu box.

I'm using ubuntu 14.04 and i have a windows AD setup.

I followed this guide. [https://blog.netnerds.net/2016/04/joining-ubuntu-to-an-active-directory-domain/](https://blog.netnerds.net/2016/04/joining-ubuntu-to-an-active-directory-domain/)

When i try to login i get this error in auth.logs

```
Mar 24 05:18:54 hostname sshd[3767]: Invalid user User [EMAIL="Name@DOMAIN.COM"]Name@DOMAIN.COM[/EMAIL] from 10.145.30.198Mar 24 05:18:54 hostname sshd[3767]: input_userauth_request: invalid user User [EMAIL="Name@DOMAIN.COM"]Name@DOMAIN.COM[/EMAIL] [preauth]

```


I have added the machine to the domain and can get a kerberos ticket so i know the machine can talk to the domain, i'm not sure what setting i've missed or what im doing wrong. Below are the config files i've had to change for this. 


This is my /etc/ssh/sshd_config file

```

This is my smb.conf file

```
## d:Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic
# errors.


#======================= Global Settings =======================


[global]


## Browsing/Identification ###


# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
        workgroup = DOMAIN.COM
        client signing = yes
        client use spnego = yes
        kerberos method = secrets and keytab
        realm = DOMAIN.COM
        security = ads




# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
        server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)


# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
#   wins support = no


# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z


# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
   dns proxy = no


#### Networking ####


# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0


# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
;   bind interfaces only = yes






#### Debugging/Accounting ####


# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m


# Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).
   max log size = 1000


# If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
# parameter to 'yes'.
#   syslog only = no


# We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
# should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log
# through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
   syslog = 0


# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d




####### Authentication #######


# Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
# values are "standalone server", "member server", "classic primary
# domain controller", "classic backup domain controller", "active
# directory domain controller".
#
# Most people will want "standalone sever" or "member server".
# Running as "active directory domain controller" will require first
# running "samba-tool domain provision" to wipe databases and create a
# new domain.
   server role = standalone server


# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.
   passdb backend = tdbsam


   obey pam restrictions = yes


# This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.
   unix password sync = yes


# For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
# parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan <<kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> for
# sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .


# This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
# when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
# 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.
   pam password change = yes


# This option controls how unsuccessful authentication attempts are mapped
# to anonymous connections
   map to guest = bad user
