title: "Access Samba Share Without Password or Map to Guest = Bad User"

### Post by damo12 on 2016-08-11
Hi,

I have a headless Ubuntu server currently running 14.04.05 which is accessed through Webmin and Putty.

I have a number of Samba shares, some of which I would like to allow guest access to Windows machines and some of which I would like to restrict access to specific users a password.

If a windows machine tries to access a "guest" share, it requests a user name and password.  If I use the user name and password for a password protected share, then access is granted to all shares.

From a LOT of searching, the standard solution to this problem is to include the line:
```
Map to Guest = Bad User
```


This will allow access to the "guest" shares without any issues but if I then try to access a password protected share I received the error message:

"Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, are not allowed"


My smb.conf is:
```
#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
#
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which 
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check that you have not made any basic syntactic 
# errors. 
# A well-established practice is to name the original file
# "smb.conf.master" and create the "real" config file with
# testparm -s smb.conf.master >smb.conf
# This minimizes the size of the really used smb.conf file
# which, according to the Samba Team, impacts performance
# However, use this with caution if your smb.conf file contains nested
# "include" statements. See Debian bug #483187 for a case
# where using a master file is not a good idea.

I have only shown 2 (renamed) shares, there are more but this will demonstrate the share setup.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

That error message is a feature not a bug. This is a security measure. You should never have an instance when a machine needs to log into a file server simultaneously as two unique users.

You'll need to log out, then log back in for your testing. This is happening on your Windows client and no configuration change in SAMBA will prevent this from occurring.

Wouldn't it work by using something like this for the guest shares:
```
guest ok = yes
```

If I'm not mistaken, in such case if you click on open share it will simply show the content. If you click on protected share it will ask you for credentials. Isn't that what you want?

Don't map it to bad user...

Hi volkswagner, I don't want to log in to the file server twice.  In Samba 3, I could access the Guest share without logging on and then access the password share by logging on when I needed to access it before logging off afterwards.  I am trying to replicate this.

darkod, I have tried "guest ok = yes" but this does not work in Samba 4.

---

### Post by darkod on 2016-08-18
I have samba4 with few open shares (I have no password shares) and they all work.

I can check the full config later when I'm at home, but I don't have many parameters for the shares. I do remember I use the guest ok. Obviously in my case the global security parameter is set to 'share', so maybe that makes a difference. You probably have it as 'user'.

Thanks Darko,

I did forget to mention that one of the computers is a laptop which for a short time had the same username and password as the password protected share.  that could access any share (guest and password) without having to log on.  From what I have read, this is because Windows automatically presents the current user's details to Samba when it tries to connect.

Once the passwords were changed, it had to log on as the other computers do.

### Post by darkod on 2016-08-18
Yes, that's normal behavior when the windows user credentials match the share credentials.

### Post by philhughes on 2016-08-18
If I am reading the samba docs correctly (link below) you need to use the "guest only = yes" option in conjunction with "guest ok = yes" (as Darko has said). The example from your smb.conf shows only "guest only = yes":

```

[GuestShare]
	directory mode = 777
	guest only = yes
	path = /media/server/GuestShareLocation
	comment = Server
	public = yes
	create mode = 777
	writeable = yes

```

Thanks, I'll try adding "guest only = yes" and "guest ok = yes" to the shares and change the security to "share" tonight when I get home and report back

---

### Post by darkod on 2016-08-18
The security setting is one of the global options, so you can't change that without affecting the password protected shares too. I would first try adding "guest ok = yes", restarting samba and see how that goes.

Changing the security parameter from user to share has more implications, and I don't know samba in such detail to estimate if it can be done as a quick test or not. Maybe it will break more things than fixing them...

It might look like very little, but this is what I have for my open shares definitions:
```
[network]
        comment = File Share
        path = /data/network
        guest ok = yes
        read only = no
```
