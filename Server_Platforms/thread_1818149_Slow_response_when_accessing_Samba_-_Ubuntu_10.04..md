title: "Slow response when accessing Samba - Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS"

### Post by mytinytown on 2011-08-04
I use Ubuntu 10.04.2 and Samba 3.4.7. I have always had a slow response to accessing  Samba. Like when I click on Samba it could take up to 30 seconds to open the folder, once opened Samba works like expected. This happens several times a day.

PC info:
Kernel and CPU    Linux 2.6.32-33-386 on i686
Processor information    AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2000+, 1 cores
Running processes    119

I do not know what I can display to help, other then maybe:
/etc/samba/smb.conf
```

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = WORKGROUP

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
#   wins support = no

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z

# This will prevent nmbd to search for NetBIOS names through DNS.
   dns proxy = no

# What naming service and in what order should we use to resolve host names
# to IP addresses
;   name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast

#### Networking ####

# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
;   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0

# Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
# 'interfaces' option above to use this.
# It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
# not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
# option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
;   bind interfaces only = yes



#### Debugging/Accounting ####

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

# Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).
   max log size = 1000

# If you want Samba to only log through syslog then set the following
# parameter to 'yes'.
#   syslog only = no

# We want Samba to log a minimum amount of information to syslog. Everything
# should go to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd} instead. If you want to log
# through syslog you should set the following parameter to something higher.
   syslog = 0

# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d


####### Authentication #######

# "security = user" is always a good idea. This will require a Unix account
# in this server for every user accessing the server. See
# /usr/share/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/Samba3-HOWTO/ServerType.html
# in the samba-doc package for details.
#   security = user

# You may wish to use password encryption.  See the section on
# 'encrypt passwords' in the smb.conf(5) manpage before enabling.
   encrypt passwords = true

# If you are using encrypted passwords, Samba will need to know what
# password database type you are using.  
   passdb backend = tdbsam

   obey pam restrictions = yes

# This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
# password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
# passdb is changed.
   unix password sync = yes

# For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
# parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan <<kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> for
# sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

# This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
# when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
# 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.
   pam password change = yes

# This option controls how unsuccessful authentication attempts are mapped 
# to anonymous connections
   map to guest = bad user

########## Domains ###########

# must have this setting enabled. If you are the BDC you must

# samba server (see below)

# Another common choice is storing the profile in the user's home directory
# (this is Samba's default)

# RPC pipe.  The example command creates a user account with a disabled Unix
# password; please adapt to your needs

# This allows Unix groups to be created on the domain controller via the SAMR
# RPC pipe.  
; add group script = /usr/sbin/addgroup --force-badname %g

########## Printing ##########

# If you want to automatically load your printer list rather
# than setting them up individually then you'll need this
#   load printers = yes

Trying NFS and not having luck.

If you want to help, I am willing to still use Samba or check out:

Are you sure that the hard drives aren't being spun down when they're idle.  This sounds like when you first hit the folder, they're spun up, and then they work as intended.

Wow, SMACK!
Never thought of that. This could very well be it.
How could I verify that they are always running?
How can I change the spin down idle time?

OK I found:

hdparm.conf
```

## This is the default configuration for hdparm for Debian.  It is a 
## rather simple script, so please follow the following guidelines :)
## Any line that begins with a comment is ignored - add as many as you 
## like.  Note that an in-line comment is not supported.  If a line 
## consists of whitespace only (tabs, spaces, carriage return), it will be
## ignored, so you can space control fields as you like.  ANYTHING ELSE
## IS PARSED!!  This means that lines with stray characters or lines that 
## use non # comment characters will be interpreted by the initscript.  
## This has probably minor, but potentially serious, side effects for your 
## hard drives, so please follow the guidelines.  Patches to improve 
## flexibilty welcome.  Please read /usr/share/doc/hdparm/README.Debian for 
## notes about known issues, especially if you have an MD array.
##
## Note that if the init script causes boot problems, you can pass 'nohdparm' 
## on the kernel command line, and the script will not be run.
##
## Uncommenting the options below will cause them to be added to the DEFAULT
## string which is prepended to options listed in the blocks below.
##
## If an option is listed twice, the second instance replaces the first.
##
## /sbin/hdparm is not run unless a block of the form:
##      DEV {
##         option
##         option
##         ...
##      }
## exists.  This blocks will cause /sbin/hdparm OPTIONS DEV to be run.
## Where OPTIONS is the concatenation of all options previously defined
## outside of a block and all options defined with in the block.

## New note - you can use straight hdparm commands in this config file 
## as well - the set up is ugly, but it keeps backwards compatibility
## Additionally, it should be noted that any blocks that begin with 
## the keyword 'command_line' are not run until after the root filesystem
## is mounted.  This is done to avoid running blocks twice.  If you need 
## to run hdparm to set parameters for your root disk, please use the 
## standard format.

#Samples follow:
#First three are good for devfs systems, fourth one for systems that do 
#not use devfs.  The fifth example uses straight hdparm command line
#syntax.  Any of the blocks that use command line syntax must begin with
#the keyword 'command_line', and no attempt is made to validate syntax.  
#It is provided for those more comfortable with hdparm syntax.
