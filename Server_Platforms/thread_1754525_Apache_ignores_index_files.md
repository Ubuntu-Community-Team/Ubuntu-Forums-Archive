Hi
My apache ignores index files (index.php ,index.html ,index.htm , ...) and while these files exists in directory apache lists directory content!
I mean [http://localhost/test/](http://localhost/test/) lists directory content instead of showing index.php!
What's the problem?
How can I fix it?

Thanks

And your config files look like?

Stick 'em in a code block with the # on the formatting bar when you post ;)

Hi
/etc/apache2/httpd.conf is empty.
and this is /etc/apache2/apache2.conf :
```

#
# Based upon the NCSA server configuration files originally by Rob McCool.
#
# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ for detailed information about
# the directives.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same Apache server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "/var/log/apache2/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "" will be interpreted by the
# server as "//var/log/apache2/foo.log".
#

### Section 1: Global Environment
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,
# such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it
# can find its configuration files.
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation (available
# at <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/mod/mpm_common.html#lockfile>);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
ServerRoot "/etc/apache2"

#
# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
#
#<IfModule !mpm_winnt.c>
#<IfModule !mpm_netware.c>
LockFile /var/lock/apache2/accept.lock
#</IfModule>
#</IfModule>

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
# This needs to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars
#
PidFile ${APACHE_PID_FILE}

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 15

Well that is the default base config... 

what do your virtualhost files in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ (may only be 000-default) have to say for themselves - and any .htacess file you have in you webroot(s) ?

Hi
In webroots i don't have any .htaccess 

In /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ i only have:
default
default-mythbuntu
default-ssl
mythweb.conf
zendserver_gui.conf

the "/etc/apache2/sites-available/default" is:
```

look in /etc/apache2/mods-available for a link to files called dir.conf and dir.load
```
 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 26 2010-12-10 08:22 dir.conf -> ../mods-available/dir.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 26 2010-12-10 08:22 dir.load -> ../mods-available/dir.load


```
If those links are not there, add them:
```
 
sudo a2enmod dir

```
if the links are already there, then check the contents of the dir.conf file. Mine looks like this:
```
 
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
          DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm
</IfModule>


```
Apache needs to be re-started after any config changes:
```
 
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

```

Hi
this mod is added already.
and it has that content :
```

ariyan@ariyan-laptop:~/Desktop$ cat /etc/apache2/mods-available/dir.conf 
<IfModule mod_dir.c>

          DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm

</IfModule>

```
but still it lists directories instead of loading index files!

Hi
I didn't need mythweb so it was solved for me.
But I still don't know what was the problem!
