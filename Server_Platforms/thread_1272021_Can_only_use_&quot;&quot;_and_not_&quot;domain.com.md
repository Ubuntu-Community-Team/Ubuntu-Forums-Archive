title: "Can only use &quot;*&quot; and not &quot;domain.com&quot; in virtualhost config"

I have two sites that need SSL encryption on my server. 

The firstsite is at /var/www/firstsite
The second site is /var/www/secondsite

My /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ config files say

<virtualhost firstsite.com:443>
ServerName [www.firstsite.com](www.firstsite.com)
DirectoryRoot /var/www/firstsite

and

<virtualhost secondsite.com:443>
ServerName [www.secondsite.com](www.secondsite.com)
DirectoryRoot /var/www/secondsite

But, things don't work. I just get a 404 error. But if I make one config file that reads

<virtualhost *:443>
DirectoryRoot /var/www/firstsite

Then things work, except secondsite and firstsite both go to firstsite.

tl;dr, using "*" works but "firstsite.com" doesn't.

Running ubuntu server 8.10.

Please paste your config files in their entirety.

Thanks for your reply. I actually just took the default-ssl I found in sites-available. But all https addresses forward to /var/www/.

We also need the files where you defined your other vhosts. ;)
