I have E2180 Dual CPU and I have compiled my own kernel. Everything is fine, only thing is that new kernel doesn't see second core. With generic ubuntu kernel, of course, there are two cores present.
I am completely sure I have included all that is needed in this kernel and now I'm begining to wonder if this maybe is some Ubuntu problem.

I'm using Ubuntu Server 8.04.

Here are my processor related config of kernel.
