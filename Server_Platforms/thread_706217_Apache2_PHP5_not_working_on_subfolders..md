title: "Apache2 PHP5 not working on subfolders."

### Post by dickohead on 2008-02-24
Good morning all (26 minutes past midnight here!),

I am having some trouble with Apache2 and PHP5. I previously had Apache2 running fine with Drupal and PHPMyAdmin, but then started playing a bit with Python, I only got as far as printing text with Python then moved on to databases.

Now I am trying to get PHPMyAdmin working again (I removed it for some reason) but in any browser I use it asks me to download the page as SHTML, now I know this occurs when php isn't loaded or isn't parsing certain files as php, but I have a file in the /var/www/ folder with the following code in it:

```

<html>
<head>
<title>PHP Info</title>
</head>
<body>
<?php
print 'It works!';
phpinfo();
?>
</body>
</html>

```

And that works fine. But if I try and run any PHP files from subdirectories or symlinks from /var/www/ they don't work.

I have removed all of my apache2, php5, python, phpmyadmin, mysql and other associated packages with the command:

```
sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2.2-common python2.4 phpmyadmin mysql php5
```

Then reinstalled, but the same thing keeps occurring over and over.

Short of formatting and starting fresh, how can I get PHPMyAdmin running?

My config files are all default install, no modification have been made, and any modifications that have been made failed to change anything, so they were changed back.

I'm starting University tomorrow afternoon and would love it if I could play with Python and some MySQL databases (hence PHPMyAdmin) during my VB.NET lecture (I know, I know).

If you need any config files anyway, or want to know what other packages I might have installed, you'll need to tell me how to get them for you as I've forgotten a lot of commands recently. (took me an hour  to remember that it's usermod not groupmod to change users groups...)

Looking forward to any replies!

If the server is asking you to download files as .shtml then it isn't recognizing
file types properly.  The likely cause is that the subdirectories do not have
the Options and Includes directives set.

[QUOTE=apache2.conf]
    #
    # Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.
    #
    # To parse .shtml files for server-side includes (SSI):
    # (You will also need to add "Includes" to the "Options" directive.)
    #
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml
[/QUOTE]

So I would check your sites-enabled files and look for the Options and
Includes directives.

I tried adding Includes to the end of my sites-enabled/000-default file, but it didn't change anything.

Here are my two config files:

/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

<VirtualHost *>
	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
	
	DocumentRoot /var/www/

		AllowOverride None
		Order allow,deny
		allow from all
		# This directive allows us to have apache2's default start page
                # in /apache2-default/, but still have / go to the right place
                #RedirectMatch ^/$ /apache2-default/

/etc/apache2/apache2.conf
> #
# Based upon the NCSA server configuration files originally by Rob McCool.
#
# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/) for detailed information about
# the directives.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same Apache server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "/var/log/apache2/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "" will be interpreted by the
# server as "//var/log/apache2/foo.log".
#

### Section 1: Global Environment
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,
# such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it
# can find its configuration files.
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation (available
# at <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/mod/mpm_common.html#lockfile>);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
ServerRoot "/etc/apache2"

#
# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
#
#<IfModule !mpm_winnt.c>
#<IfModule !mpm_netware.c>
LockFile /var/lock/apache2/accept.lock
#</IfModule>
#</IfModule>

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
#
PidFile /var/run/apache2.pid

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 15

# viewed by Web clients.

#
# DefaultType is the default MIME type the server will use for a document
# if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.
# If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, "text/plain" is
# a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications
# or images, you may want to use "application/octet-stream" instead to
# keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are
# text.
#
DefaultType text/plain

#
# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., [www.apache.org](www.apache.org) (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.
#
HostnameLookups Off

# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
#
ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log

#
# LogLevel: Control the number of messages logged to the error_log.
# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
# alert, emerg.
#
LogLevel warn

# Include module configuration:
Include /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*.load
Include /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*.conf

# Include all the user configurations:
Include /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

# Include ports listing

#
# The following directives define some format nicknames for use with
# a CustomLog directive (see below).
#

LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
LogFormat "%{Referer}i -> %U" referer
LogFormat "%{User-agent}i" agent

#
# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The default is 'Full' which sends information about the OS-Type
# and compiled in modules.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minor | Minimal | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
#
ServerTokens Full

#
# Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host
# name to server-generated pages (internal error documents, FTP directory 
# listings, mod_status and mod_info output etc., but not CGI generated 
# documents or custom error documents).
# Set to "EMail" to also include a mailto: link to the ServerAdmin.
# Set to one of:  On | Off | EMail
#
ServerSignature On



#
# Customizable error responses come in three flavors:
# 1) plain text 2) local redirects 3) external redirects
#
# Some examples:
#ErrorDocument 500 "The server made a boo boo."
#ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#ErrorDocument 404 "/cgi-bin/missing_handler.pl"
#ErrorDocument 402 [http://www.example.com/subscription_info.html](http://www.example.com/subscription_info.html)
#

#
# Putting this all together, we can internationalize error responses.
#
# We use Alias to redirect any /error/HTTP_<error>.html.var response to
# our collection of by-error message multi-language collections.  We use 
# includes to substitute the appropriate text.
#
# You can modify the messages' appearance without changing any of the
# default HTTP_<error>.html.var files by adding the line:
#
#   Alias /error/include/ "/your/include/path/"
#
# which allows you to create your own set of files by starting with the
# /usr/share/apache2/error/include/ files and copying them to /your/include/path/, 
# even on a per-VirtualHost basis.  The default include files will display
# your Apache version number and your ServerAdmin email address regardless
# of the setting of ServerSignature.
#
# The internationalized error documents require mod_alias, mod_include
# and mod_negotiation.  To activate them, uncomment the following 30 lines.

#    Alias /error/ "/usr/share/apache2/error/"
#

NameVirtualHost *
<VirtualHost *>
ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
**DirectoryIndex index.html index.shtml index.php**

```

Try adding that bolded line to the default config file.

Thanks faulkes, but unfortunately it didn't change anything. :(

I tried both:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart
```
and
```
sudo /etc/init.d/apache force-reload
```

### Post by faulkes on 2008-03-02
Yes, but for some reason I don't see the earlier text I quote from
apache2.conf being in your quoted apache2.conf

For the record:

```

#
# Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.
#
# To parse .shtml files for server-side includes (SSI):
# (You will also need to add "Includes" to the "Options" directive.)
#
AddType text/html .shtml
AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml

```

Search your apache2.conf for the "shtml" to make sure it exists and is
uncommented.  If it doesn't exist, copy and paste the above to the
bottom of the apache2.conf file.

Then run:

```

apache2ctl configtest

```

It should return saying "Syntax OK".

Then:

```

/etc/init.d/apach2 restart

```

Nope... same problem.

But if I access the IP address of my machine from another machine - it all works perfectly!

When on the local machine I have been trying to access it using: localhost and 127.0.0.1.

But if I use the DHCP'd IP address... it works.

Must be something screwed with the FQDN or DNS settings...

Thanks for all your help mate, I'll check my other settings, or just access it using the DHCP address!

Thanks again mate.

Hi, 

Did you ever find a misconfiguration of Apache2 or your system?

I am having similar problems with phpmyadmin, but strangly only under certain circumstances:

If I browse a database table, e.g. with 1000 rows, Apache2 works fine if I browse 100 rows, but as soon as I try to list the full database, the PHP file is saved to a file?? 

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Hans

### Post by dickohead on 2008-05-09
No I didn't sorry, I've since installed Hardy and all my problems went away (even some old issues were corrected!).

My only words of advice are that if you are going to be developing something and you fear it might screw up - use a virtual appliance!
