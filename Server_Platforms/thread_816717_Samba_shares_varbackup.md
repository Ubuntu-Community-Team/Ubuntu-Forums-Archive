title: "Samba shares /var/backup"

### Post by e30power on 2008-06-03
I had a 6.10 server that I pulled the HD out of and put into my 8.04 server in order to get the data off of. I mounted the whole HD into /backup, and created a samba share named "Backup", read only for all authorized users. After I copied all the data off, I deleted the share, un-mounted the HD, and deleted the /backup directory off my 8.04 server. 
However, I am still able to see the backup share, and it is pointing to /var/backup, and I am allowed to see all the contents of /var/backup. As you can see from my configuration file, I dont have any backup share. Is this a known bug? I have restarted samba as well as the server multiple times, and the problem remains.
Thanks,
Rob
