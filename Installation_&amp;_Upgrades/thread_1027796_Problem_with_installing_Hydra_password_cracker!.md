I have been reading relevant posts in this forum, about installing in Ubuntu 8.10 Hydra but nothing!

Well when I run the configuration file I get:

```
Starting hydra auto configuration ...

Checking for openssl (libssl/ssl.h) ...
                                    ... NOT found, SSL support disabled
Get it from http://www.openssl.org
Checking for Postgres (libpq) ...
                              ... found
Checking for SVN (ibsvn_client-1 libapr-0.so libaprutil-0.so) ...
                              ... found
Checking for SAP/R3 (librfc/saprfc.h) ...
                                      ... NOT found, module sapr3 disabled
Get it from http://www.sap.com/solutions/netweaver/linux/eval/index.asp
Checking for libssh (libssh/libssh.h) ...
                                      ... NOT found, module ssh2 disabled
Get it from http://0xbadc0de.be/ - use v0.11!

Hydra will be installed into .../bin of: /usr/local
  (change this by running ./configure --prefix=path)

Writing Makefile.in ...

NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES
=======================================================================
ARM/PalmPilot users: please run ./configure-arm or ./configure-palm respectivly

now type "make"

```

Now openssl is already installed in my system so...what is wrong :(
then I tried make, and make install to see more detailed errors:


```

```

I also make install:

```
gcc -I. -Wall -O2 -c hydra-sip.c -DLIBPOSTGRES 
hydra-sip.c:4:25: error: openssl/ssl.h: No such file or directory

hydra-sip.c:60: warning: unused variable ‘urp’
make: *** [hydra-sip.o] Error 1

```

Then I tried make and sudo apt-get install and I got:

```
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  linux-headers-2.6.27-7 linux-headers-2.6.27-7-generic
Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.

```

Well it probably something wrong with the PATHS!!! but what any ideas????

My guess is you need the development versions of those programs.

libssl-dev
libssh-2-dev
