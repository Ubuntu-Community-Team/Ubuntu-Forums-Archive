I am not sure you gain a lot with the Intel SRT when dual booting. Windows required vendors to implement faster booting and SRT is the main solution they have used.

I do not think it matters on what vendor as the Intel SRT is standard by all vendors. Screens may look slightly different.

> Disable the RAID, it was using the Intel rapid management thingy and telling it to disable the acceleration or the use of the SSD. If you have a different system, just disable the RAID system then install Ubuntu. Once installed you can then re-enable it.
sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda
sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sdb
> You will need to use the dmraid command prior to running the Ubuntu Installer so that it will be able to see the partitions on the drive because otherwise with the raid metadata in place it will see the drive as part of a raid set and ignore its partitions.
