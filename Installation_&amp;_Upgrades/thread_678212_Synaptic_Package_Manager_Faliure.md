### Post by Sctt on 2008-01-25
Each time I start up Synaptic Package Manager, this error comes up.


```
E: Type 'sudo' is not known on line 58 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list
E: The list of sources could not be read.
Go to the repository dialog to correct the problem.
E: _cache->open() failed, please report.
```



Is there a quick fix for this?








Here is my sources.list:

The last 3 lines are linux commands, not meant to be entered in /etc/apt/sources.list. You are meant to enter them in the terminal. (Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal)

EDIT : To fix : Open the terminal:

Enter the following:
```
gksudo gedit
```

And delete the last 3 lines : 

sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get install zsnes32
sudo -i
