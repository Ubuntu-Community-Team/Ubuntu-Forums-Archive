I have windows 7 installed and set to take about half the hard drive. I try to install ubuntu, and it doesn't recognize that i have 7 installed. I included boot info. any help would be appreciated. 

Obviously I am very new to the OS but so far i like it.

Welcome to UF.
What part of the installation did you get to? Does the installer show anything for your hard drive?

---

### Post by konohasaint on 2011-05-09
well I can install clean and use the whole HD, and everything works fine if i install. If i have windows there it shows the hard drive is completely free as if there wasn't an already existing partition. My options are erase and install or something else. Since i cant see the partition that already exists not sure if creating a new one is a good idea.

The boot script detects remnants of a GPT (or GUID Partition Table). What machine are you using? Has this hard drive been used in a Mac?

---

### Post by Rubi1200 on 2011-05-09
I also wanted to ask about that. If there is stray GPT data the Ubuntu installer may have an issue recognizing the drive (as you noticed).

There is a fantastic utility called fixparts, written  by forum member srs5694, that can take care of this for you:
[http://www.rodsbooks.com/fixparts/](http://www.rodsbooks.com/fixparts/)

Once you have removed the stray data, you can try installing again.

Hope this helps.

As Quackers says, the disk has remnants of GPT data on it, which can get there from use in a Mac, in a previous Linux installation that used GPT, or in various other ways. Technically, your disk is now an MBR disk (MBR being the more common partitioning system on PCs), but the Ubuntu installer becomes confused by the stray GPT data and can't see any partitions at all. You can fix the problem by using my [FixParts]("http://www.rodsbooks.com/fixparts/") program. Its Web page describes its use. You can use the Windows version or install the Linux version in your Ubuntu installer in its "live CD" mode, as you prefer.

Edit: Rubi1200 beat me to it! ;)

Yeah it was a Mac for a bit, this acer machine does great with all the OS's. I would really like to TRI-boot mac os, ubuntu and windows. Just havent found a way that works with Mac OS. I can run that perfect right up until i do multiboot then mac os gets retarded and graphics dont work right... but I will try your utility and see what happens and report back

---

### Post by Quackers on 2011-05-09
Fixparts will sort it out :-)

---

### Post by konohasaint on 2011-05-24
hey everyone, just wanted to thank you for helping on this one.

---

### Post by Quackers on 2011-05-24
You're welcome :-)
I'm sure I can speak for srs5694 too.
oops, and Rubi1200 too! Sorry Rubi

---

### Post by Rubi1200 on 2011-05-24
No problem, you are more than welcome :-) 

We are all glad you got things sorted out.

Enjoy!
