Hi,

I installed an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on an HP ProBook 5320m

Now, when I boot the system the machine says invalid boot device. When I press F9 and point the boot EFI file, I can boot the machine fine.
I tried already to change the boot order, looking at the HD first, no difference.
Unfortunately, I can't save the EFI file to boot, so I guess I should update the partitions somehow.

I tried already boot-repair, but it just has copied a fresh EFI file for loading Grub.

What can I try?

Every HP we have seen needs a work around. Most rename or create /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi and boot a hard drive entry in UEFI.

HP to get into UEFI/BIOS menu - escape then f10 as soon as it starts. Key board issues try different USB ports maybe  front.
