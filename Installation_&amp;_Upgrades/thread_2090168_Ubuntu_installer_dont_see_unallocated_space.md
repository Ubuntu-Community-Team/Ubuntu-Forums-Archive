Hello,

I'm completly new with Linux and I have a problem with installation. On my laptop HP Pavilion dv 6 I have already installed Windows 7 and I want to install Ubuntu also. I have some unallocated space what I want to use to installation. During installation in installation type window I choose something else. Then I have list with partitions I have there my 2 windows 7 partitions, 1 system partitions and one what I really dont know what it is. It have only 1MB and becouse of thet I have already 4 partitions I cant choose my unallocated space to install ubuntu. In attachment I enclose screen from disc management. Do any one know what can I do to use unallocated space to install ubuntu?

Welcome to the forums.

Your screen shot shows what looks like dynamic partition. Windows standard is basic partitions. If using the Windows partition tools you try to create more than the 4 allowed primary partitions in MBR(msdos) partitioning Windows converts to dynamic which does not work with Linux. The free versions of some of the Windows partition tools used to include conversion from dynamic. It now looks like the free version does not include that. But you may find the older versions on other download sites and should still be able to use that.

       Dynamic volume is a Microsoft proprietary format developed together with Veritas (now acquired by Symantec) for logical volumes.
You may be use a third-party tool, such as Partition Wizard MiniTool or EASEUS to convert a convert a dynamic disk to a basic disk without having to delete or format them.
I've never used any of these and so I can't be sure they will work.Be sure to have good backups as any major partition change has risks.

   Used EASEUS Partition Master -  free version used to  include conversion

EASEUS Partition Master - The free home edition converted both dynamic partitions into basic partitions in less than 5 minutes!!

   Several users have used this, it has a liveCD download to use but you have to use the non-free version:
MiniTool Partition Wizard Professional Edition 5.2 to convert without loss of data the disk from dynamic disk to a basic disk.
also used Partition Wizard to set an existing partition logical instead of primary
Converted from dynamic with MiniTool, & repaired windows
