title: "Upgrade failure from 9.10 to 10.04.2 - help required"

forum: Installation &amp; Upgrades

### Post by Red.Dwarf on 2011-02-03
Hi everyone, I have attempted to do an update using update manager from 9.10 which was upgraded from 9.04 to 10.04.2 and although it seemed to go okay up to the reboot after that I was left with a system that would not boot any of the available kernels, 2.6.32-28-generic, 2.6.31-19-gen or 2.6.28-15-gen. It just ends in a black screen. I did once see an Ubuntu logo briefly but don't know what I did to get to that but it was from the kernel selection menu.

I get the boot menu where I can select the three kernels and recovery mode and from the recovery selection it does show a square graphical?/text menu to select the available options. From there I can get to the console with or without network.

I did change my video card from an ATI HD3850 to a nvidia GT240 recently but did not uninstall the ATI packages. I don't know whether this could be part of the problem. The desktop did seem to be working okay and fairly quickly compared with Windows when it doesn't have drivers installed.

My Linux knowledge is pretty basic so I would like some advice on what I can do to recover this as I did wait around for an hour or more while it downloaded the updates and installed them so I don't want to have to start from scratch unless essential.

This is a multi boot system with a few windows installs and Ubuntu which was setup using EasyBCD. First it boots to Windowa Boot Manager, selecting Linux on that then boots Grub4Dos 0.4.5b which presents a text Linux kernel selection menu with options for windows.

Selecting a Kernel and everything shoots off screen very quickly, the pause key can catch a little of it such as 

setting root to (hd2,4)
filesystem ext2fs partition type 0x83
Linux bzImage, setup 0x3400, size 0x3da020
but the next line goes to fast to catch.

Is there any way to view the boot log?

So can anyone advise on what I can do to attempt a recovery? Any questions and I will attempt to answer as best I can.

Do you have an /etc/X11/xorg.conf file on the machine and if so what does it contain?  You can find it easily from a live CD or even from recovery mode, and as a start I suggest you boot into the latest kernel recovery mode which is second in the menu usually.  Having booted to the recovery mode command line run ```
cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf
```to see if one exists.

It probably does if you had a previous proprietary driver, and it may be that simply deleting it or renaming it will allow you to boot to a gui in low resolution, and then install the proprietary driver needed for your current setup.  Try ```
mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.confbak
``` to rename the file and reboot.

Good luck.  If it is still not working come back again, and we'll see what else may be worth trying.

Thanks for the reply. There was a xorg.conf file with a little bit of info in it. I have tried what you suggested and renamed it but it didn't get any further. The monitor goes into power saving which brings back my 2nd PC display which are both connected to my monitor.

I have 4 partitions for Linux, first on the drive is a 8GB swap partition, then 102MB partition which is for the kernel and then a root partition of 32GB and finally a home partition of 2GB. There is also a large NTFS data folder after those.

Is there a way to check the boot log to see what is hapoening and whether anything isn't working right? It was working fine before the upgrade apart from not installing the nVidia driver or removing the ATI driver.

What do you mean by "brings back my 2nd PC display"?  Does that one work?

That's an interesting partition layout, but I don't see that as a related problem to your display, or lack of display.  I am now a bit out of my depth, as I expected at least some display to appear when no xorg.conf was present.

As last resort try editing the grub command from the menu.  Hit "E" at the menu, then use cursor keys to get to the line with kernel info, and remove the **quiet splash** at the end but add **nomodeset** then hit Ctrl+X to boot.  I thought this was mainly for ATI cards, but is worth a try, it does not continue with that next boot, but can be set if needed in /etc/default/grub

The two PC's are connected to one monitor and after Linux boots the display goes to standby which makes the monitor auto switch to the active display which is my 2nd PC.

> That's an interesting partition layout, but I don't see that as a related problem to your display, or lack of display.  I am now a bit out of my depth, as I expected at least some display to appear when no xorg.conf was present.Yeah the swap partition is bigger than it needs to be I think.

I thought this was mainly for ATI cards, but is worth a try, it does not continue with that next boot, but can be set if needed in /etc/default/grubWill give it a try when I reboot. ATM I'm using a LiveCD to see what partitions are viewable. It finds an important partition which was missing from the previous 9.10 version because I noticed that it was missing.

I have had a look through the log files but cannot see anything notable. fstab does say that / was on /dev/sda6 during install (DI)
/boot WO /dev/sda5 DI
/home WO /dev/sda7 DI

swap is now on /dev/sdb5 which seems strange as it's on the first partition of the hard drive with / /boot and /home. Drives and partitions have been changed since I first installed Linux.

mtab shows

/dev/sdc5 /boot
/dev/sdc6 /
/dev/sdc7 /home

Other than that I cannot see anything notable.

I have d/l'd 10.04 install CD and got it on a USB flash drive in case I need it but I would like to get the current one working again if possible. Nothing really to lose if I don't but finding out why it all went **** up would be nice.

It didn't work unfortunately. I did remove the final line quiet to see the output and it did say that there was a problem activating swap so it looks like that was not referring to the correct location. I did change that in fstab to /dev/sdc5 instead of sdb5. It didn't affect anything.

So if anyone else has any suggestions please share them.

I still suspect a graphics card driver problem, but I have never had to do anything with that for my machine, which has always worked with the open source drivers in place at installation.

have a good search around the forum for your GT240  and best driver to see if that helps you at all.

I think you are right, it's just a case of identifying where the problem lies.

mmmm, I didn't install any nVidia driver so surely this cannot affect me? I had an ATI driver installed before the upgrade which was a remanent left over after switching my video cards. I didn't remove it like I should of done but I did not install any nVidia driver myself, only the upgrade could of done that automatically.

 I will take note of it as it will affect me when I get it working.

The link above which you gave does sound like what I am experiencing. The monitor switching off and the keyboard not responding but I don't see how it could be for the same reason as there should be no nVidia driver installed. The upgrade wouldn't of installed a driver would it?

Is there a way to check or improve the logging of the display detection and related things to attempt to discover what is happening? I did look through kern.log, boot.log, dmesg, debug, syslog but they are very big and I could of missed something not really knowing what I was supposed to be looking for. Is there any way to narrow it down? The correct log to look at?

Booting kernel 2.6.28-15-generic does boot differently to the other two kernels. It does get further as it shows an Ubuntu logo in the centre of the screen like I mentioned before but didn't know how I had got to that ATT. But after that sometimes it shows a border around the screen and other times the cursor can be seen at the very bottom of the screen but cannot be moved up. After that which lasts a few seconds (10) the screen goes black like it does with the other kernels. Sometimes the ubuntu logo can be seen broken up on separate lines with blank scan lines between each line and the screen flickering. It's like the resolution/refresh rate is incorrectly set so the display cannot be locked by the monitor.

Where is the resolution/refresh rate stored? Can this be checked and manually modified?

I have tried lsmod to see what modules are loaded but can see no references to ati drivers except for a Remote Wonder. There are none for nVidia either. The only ATI other than remote wonder that I found were the ATI 9.9? driver install files ATI******.run.

Starting X from the console results in a black screen as with booting the kernels normally.

So can anyone tell me where the resolution/refresh rate are stored? Can this be checked and manually modified?

I've got the X server log file and would appreciate it if someone could look over it to find out why this isn't working. I don't know how X normally works so don't know what is right and what is wrong with it. It looks like it is detecting my GT240 but it is unloading the default drivers nv_drv for it for some reason. It then attempts to use the Vesa driver.

So can anyone who knows the ins and outs of X server have a look at it please?

Is it worth me installing the latest nVidia drivers from their website or would this be a bad idea?

Installing the nVidia driver did the trick. I did follow the recommendations given in [this thread]("http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1470343"). That included removing previous nvidia drivers, blacklisting two drivers and installing a couple of necessary items, one of which was already installed.  I'm currently posting from Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. :p
