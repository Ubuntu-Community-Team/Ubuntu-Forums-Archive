wtf?

when I now start vmplayer and choose to open WindowsXPVirtualMachine.vmx, I get error "Could not open /dev/vmmon: No such file or directory. Please make sure that the kernel module `vmmon' is loaded." and "Failed to initialize monitor device." (there is some third error as well but it vanishes quicker that I can notice it)

save me please :)

Is your dpkg, apt-get, or Synaptic working?
