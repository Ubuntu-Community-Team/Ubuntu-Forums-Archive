First, the wireless card you are using needs to be provided so we can see what it is before offering any suggestions. At the CLI (Applications>>Accessories>>Terminal) type```
lspci
```and post the output here.

I've installed Ubuntu 8.04 eight months ago. I didn't succeed in making my wireless card work.

I've tried to install the drivers using "ndis *wrapper*", I've tried to change the network manager (from default to wicd), but without success. nor the wireless led turn on!

The code that appear typing lscpi is the following:
