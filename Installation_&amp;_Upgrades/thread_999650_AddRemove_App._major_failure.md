Hello,

When I turn the Add/Remove application on, it says:

This is a major failure of your software management system. Please check for broken packages with synaptic, check the file permissions and correctness of the file '/etc/apt/sources.list' and reload the software information with: 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install -f'.

I have run 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install -f'. 
It is not doing any good.

So I have gotten the gedit of /etc/apt/sources.list
and I have no idea what is wrong with it.

Please help me :(
