Hello everyone.
I come to you guys again asking for help to partition my USB drive(500GB) , and i would like to install Ubuntu on it completely . But I do not know which partitions i need create and how much space each partition should have,so I need help.
NOTE: As the flash drive has a lot of space i will also create the SWAP area but i do not know how much space is needed for this partition.
Thank you.

UEFI or BIOS boot?
Either way I now suggest gpt over the 35 year old MBR partitioning.

       GPT Advantages (older but still valid)  see post#2 by srs5694:

UEFI Advantages

But with with UEFI install is a bit more tricky as you have to partition in advance and include an ESP - efi system partition. But grub will only install to ESP on sda, so you have to copy files to sdb's ESP.
If BIOS and gpt partitioning, you must have a 1 or 2MB bios_grub partition. 
I normally make all gpt drives with both the ESP & bios_grub, so in future I can install Ubuntu even if currently planned only as data drive and in either boot mode.

       
 For the Total space you want for Ubuntu:
Ubuntu's standard install is just / (root) & swap, but it is better to add another partition for /home if allocating over 30GB.:
Only if gpt -  all partitions in gpt are primary (no logicals):
gpt: 300 MB efi FAT32 w/boot flag (for UEFI boot or future use for UEFI, you only can have one per drive, so if already existing do not attempt another)
gpt: 1 or 2 MB No Format w/bios_grub flag (for BIOS boot not required for UEFI)
for gpt(GUID) or MBR(msdos) partitioning
Ubuntu partitions - smaller root only where hard drive space is limited.
If total space less than about 30GB just use / not separate /home or standard install.


[LIST=1]
[*]20-25 GB Mountpoint / primary or logical beginning ext4 
[*]all but 2 GB Mountpoint /home logical beginning ext4 
[*]2 GB Mountpoint swap logical 
[/LIST]
    Depending on how much memory you have you may not absolutely need swap but having some is still recommended. I do not hibernate (boots fast enough for me) but if hibernating then you need swap equal to RAM in GiB not GB. And if dual booting with windows a shared NTFS partition is also recommended. But you usually cannot create that as part of the install, just leave some space. Or partition in advance (recommended).
One advantage of partitioning in advance is that the installer will use the swap space to speed up the install. Thanks Herman for the tip.

suggested partitions for just Ubuntu on 3TB drive.

For any full install to a second internal or external device, drive or flash drive, you must use Something Else.
       Any install with Something Else which is required with  external drives or any second drive or any install with separate /home

 Lots of detail, screenshots and essential info.14.04  Something Else example

Also shows combo box with location of grub2 boot loader

Does not hightlight changing boot loader to sdb, if external drive, but shows other install screenshots:

Ok,thanks 
Just for info I will not install with dualboot and about your question,   I is by BOIS boot selecting to boot by USB Drive(External Drive), without change the boot order in settings.

So, it will be :

Over 30GB for home ext4
25GB fot  [COLOR=#000000]Mountpoint / ext4
2GB for SWAP

Well i was think that i can use 300 GB for home to save a lot of files and the rest to use for SWAP and SYSTEM reserved ([/COLOR][COLOR=#000000]Mountpoint)[/COLOR][COLOR=#000000]
