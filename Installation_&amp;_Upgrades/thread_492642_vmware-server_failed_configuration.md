Trying to find a suitable vmmon module for your running kernel.

None of the pre-built vmmon modules for VMware Server is suitable for your 
running kernel.  Do you want this program to try to build the vmmon module for 
your system (you need to have a C compiler installed on your system)? [yes] 

Using compiler "/usr/bin/gcc". Use environment variable CC to override.

What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running
kernel? [/lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/build/include]

hey.. ran into the same problem.. seems theres a bug or smthn with feisty..

[http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_feisty_fawn_vmware_server_howto](http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_feisty_fawn_vmware_server_howto)

theres a solution there about patching the config..

i believe you have to reinstall though because you already ran config.pl..

but ive got another problem.. cant seem to locate my gcc..

errr
