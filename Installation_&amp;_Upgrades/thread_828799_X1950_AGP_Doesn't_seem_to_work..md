### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-14
Hi all.

I'm almost at my wits end, I seem to have followed every guide, read every wiki and viewed every thread. I just can't seem to get my AGP card to work properly with Ubuntu 8.04. When I first booted up, I was in the correct resolution (1200 by 1920) and my monitor was detected correctly. A small popup was displayed asking for me to enable restricted drivers for ATI. I eagerly accepted it, rebooted, hoping to be able to enjoy compiz-fusion, however I was presented with a black screen at login.
Since then, I have set my aperture size to 512Mb (the same as my card). I have tried envy, I have done this: [http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide](http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide) (both methods), however I found out that that isn't known to work on AGP cards.

What can I do!

At the moment my xorg.conf is the following, since my last reinstallation, I have run envy, then removed it, then I installed the restricted drivers, then used the recovery console to generate this.

```

I have managed to install the latest ATI driver from their website, after running "aticonfig --initial" I still cannot open catalyst control centre, nor can I boot up to anything but a black screen.
I ran compiz-check and all the lights were green, however typing compiz just gets me to a white screen with the cursor on top.
Incidentally, is there any way of shutting down the computer from the black screen other than pressing the restart button on the case. I have tried doing it blind, however that doesn't work, I'm not sure that it even gets to the logon screen, as I don't hear the jingle.

Bump,

I tried using the open source Radeon drivers, However these still yield a white screen for compiz.

I am considering using another distribution, I quite like gnome and Ubuntu, would another ubuntu version offer better support for my card?

Use at own risk: [http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html](http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html)

Envy is a solid script, easy to use and gets the job done in most cases. It's just not officially supported, and things can go wrong.

> **Jophish said:**
> I have tried envyWoops I missed that.

ATI drivers really are a pain in the ****. I count myself very lucky I have a Nvidia card. ATI just haven't delivered stable and functional Linux drivers, like Intel and Nvidia hava.

---

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-15
Would I have any more luck with a different linux distribution? Perhaps an earlier version of Ubuntu?

---

### Post by tenmoi on 2008-06-15
I guess that you haven't followed the instructions well. Still I can see
 "Section "Extensions"
        Option "Composite" "Enable"
EndSection"

which should be Option "Composite" "false".

Please read carefully the instructions from beginning to end before you install the driver.

a side note: I do not know if the howto is up-to-date, but if you had read carefully you may have not seen that your card is not supported.

Best of luck.

---

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-15
Hmm, I'm sure that they say that it should be enable,

I only tried that driver because I had tried everything else.

Can anyone recommend another Linux distro (preferably with gnome) that is compatible with my card?

### Post by argail1980 on 2008-06-15
I think this is a problem with the xorg-server and your card and probably most distros will have that. have you tried with the fglrx driver?

I have tried the fglrx drivers.

What I am going to do at the moment is go to gutsy, However the installer from the live CD refuses to work, with an IO error (I cant get rid of this no matter which HDD I load to, no how slow i burn the CD) I tried the minimal CD for a network install, However this has trouble too, and it can't seem to connect to the internet. Incedentally the live CD can't connect to the web either, although I can ping any IP on my LAN fine, It seems to be a DNS problem. I wonder why gutsy (nor Debian Etch) has problem connecting to the internet.
At the moment I am downloading the Gutsy alternate CD, hopefully this will work.

Also, as a side note, I can't get the fedora 9 live CD to boot, it has trouble with fstab, and after the part in the installation where it prompts you to press "I" the signal to my screen is cut.

Thanks for your help so far.

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-15
Well, I have my card working in Gutsy. When I click on extra visual effects in appearance, It gives me the message: "the composite extention is not available".

What can I do about this?

---

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-16
I typed "compiz" in terminal, and I got these errors:

jophish@Joe-Linux:~$ compiz
Checking for Xgl: not present. 
Detected PCI ID for VGA: 01:00.0 0300: 1002:7280 (prog-if 00 [VGA])
Checking for texture_from_pixmap: not present. 
Trying again with indirect rendering:
Checking for texture_from_pixmap: not present. 
aborting and using fallback: /usr/bin/metacity

Any help?

do not use compiz for some time till the support from ati drivers get better...

have you this section here in your xorg.conf?

```
Section "Extensions"
    Option "Composite" "Enable"
EndSection
```

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-19
I had compiz and full 3D acceleration in Gutsy. However for some reason, opening programs in gutsy was really slow. I saw this thread: [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=769841](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=769841)

I thought that I would be able tog et it working in Hardy, however I still get a black screen. Also, I cant seem to get the correct resolution for my screen (1920x1200), instead I get 1600x1200. I wonder what changed from Gutsy to Hardy that stopped the ATI fglrx drivers from working with my card.

If that won't work, would somebody be able to point me to a different distrubution? preferably one with gnome, as I quite like that interface.

---

### Post by prince_niceguy on 2008-06-19
Please post your xorg.conf. I too have ati card on my htpc and it sucks big time to get it work in linux. I am not sure if other distro will help as it is more of a driver problem with ati not ubuntu problem. It would be same with other distros too.

At the moment its this: and it works:

```
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Generic Keyboard"
	Driver		"kbd"
	Option		"XkbRules"	"xorg"
	Option		"XkbModel"	"pc105"

	Option		"XkbOptions"	"lv3:ralt_switch"

	EndSubSection

EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"Default Layout"
	Screen		"Default Screen"
EndSection
```

I would put driver fglrx in the device section to get it to use the ATI driver, and get a black screen. I am also going to enable composite. and put Option "MaxGARTSize" "512". I am in the process of scanning my music library at the the moment, should be done in a few minutes, I will start experimenting again then.
I had it working perfectly under Gutsy though just not in Hardy.

---

### Post by prince_niceguy on 2008-06-19
include this in the driver section

```

Section "Device"
	[...]
#       Driver          "vesa"
	Driver		"fglrx"
	Option		"VideoOverlay"		"on"
	Option		"OpenGLOverlay"		"off"
	[...]
EndSection

```

that should make application and video playback faster.

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-19
But would it actualy allow me to log in?

would you be able to explain what havong two drivers in it does too, I am interested.

---

### Post by prince_niceguy on 2008-06-19
it is kind of hardware rendering rather than software rendering.

---

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-19
Other distros may help, it worked in Gutsy, perhaps its the kernel that dislikes this driver.

Anyway, I tried loading with this:

### Post by prince_niceguy on 2008-06-19
did you try out restoring xserver? that would reduce the resolution but atleast it should get you to login screen.

---

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-19
Whats that?

rescue boot, and then fix x server?

thats what I'm doing at the moment. I have it running at a lower resolution at the moment, its getting the card to accellerate 3D thats the problem.

---

### Post by prince_niceguy on 2008-06-19
yes you are right... rescue boot and fix xserver...

BTW how have you installed the fglrx using restricted driver from repo or using the ati driver from website?

---

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-19
I have tried it both ways, the one that is installed at the moment was done using method 2 here: [http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide](http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide)

---

### Post by prince_niceguy on 2008-06-19
well that may be an issue... you are using hardy installation guide for gutsy... i have ati and it is working fine for me... and i am having hd3200 on 780g fairly new... compared to your card. i think it should be supported. i would again recommend you move to hardy instead of gutsy... there are lots of updates from backport... hopefully that would work for you too.

---

### Post by Jophish on 2008-06-19
oh, no no no. you've got the wrong end of the stick. I had 3D accelelration working on Gutsy, but I upgraded to Hardy, as Gutsy was running very slowly on my system. I am trying to get it to work in Hardy.

## ## Start Default Options ##
## default kernel options
## default kernel options for automagic boot options
## If you want special options for specific kernels use kopt_x_y_z
## where x.y.z is kernel version. Minor versions can be omitted.
## e.g. kopt=root=/dev/hda1 ro
##      kopt_2_6_8=root=/dev/hdc1 ro

## Setup crashdump menu entries
## e.g. crashdump=1
# crashdump=0

## default grub root device
## e.g. groot=(hd0,0)
# groot=()/ubuntu/disks

## should update-grub create alternative automagic boot options
## e.g. alternative=true
##      alternative=false
# alternative=true

## should update-grub lock alternative automagic boot options
## e.g. lockalternative=true
##      lockalternative=false
# lockalternative=false

## additional options to use with the default boot option, but not with the
## alternatives
## e.g. defoptions=vga=791 resume=/dev/hda5
# defoptions=quiet splash

## should update-grub lock old automagic boot options
## e.g. lockold=false
##      lockold=true

## Xen hypervisor options to use with the default Xen boot option
# xenhopt=

## Xen Linux kernel options to use with the default Xen boot option
# xenkopt=console=tty0

## altoption boot targets option
## multiple altoptions lines are allowed
## e.g. altoptions=(extra menu suffix) extra boot options
##      altoptions=(recovery) single
# altoptions=(recovery mode) single

## controls how many kernels should be put into the menu.lst
## only counts the first occurence of a kernel, not the
## alternative kernel options
## e.g. howmany=all
##      howmany=7

Hi Garferi, 

I had the exact same problem as you were. This is what I did to solve it.

[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5505853#post5505853](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5505853#post5505853)

It's a combination of different solutions, but it definitely works. I replicated it twice and since then I've been running Compiz with all effects maxed with no problem.

(Sorry for starting it in a new thread, but this one was just fill of solutions that weren't working for me.)

ATi driver version 8.10 sooolved the problem on my Ubuntu Hardy Heron 8.04.1 system! :) 6 months needed to solve this, lol :D
Download it from [here]("https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/ati-driver-installer-8-10-x86.x86_64.run").
Put it to your home folder and copy the code to the terminal, than follow the instructions of the graphical installer.
```
sudo sh ati-driver-installer-8-10-x86.x86_64.run
```
After the installation paste these to terminal:
```
sudo aticonfig --initial -f
```
```
sudo aticonfig --input=/etc/X11/xorg.conf --tls=1
```

Restart your computer.

The newest driver in every month is [here]("http://ati.amd.com/support/drivers/linux/linux-radeon.html").
I also have Compiz-Fusion working, and about 4000 FPS in glxgears. :)
Now I have just one problem, the videos are blinking in the players. I have waiting for the solutions...
Thx!

Good luck All!
