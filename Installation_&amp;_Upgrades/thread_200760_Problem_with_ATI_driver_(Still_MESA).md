Hi, i have followed each guide about installing ati i could find on this forum by searching for ati. Everyone goes thru the same just in diffrent ways so i tried them all :) Still doh Mesa WONT go away and driver wont work. 

The glxgears wont move either sometimes it moves in the start then it stops just after 4 secs or so.

Here is my output on fglrxinfo:
```
$ fglrxinfo
display: :0.0  screen: 0
OpenGL vendor string: Mesa project: www.mesa3d.org
OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
OpenGL version string: 1.2 (1.5 Mesa 6.4.1
```

Here is xorg.conf:

Have you tried rebooting?  Really, I think I had this symptom even after restarting X and gdm and everything else I could think of.  Then it was working after the next reboot.  I guess this is one of the few things that really require a good old reboot.

make sure that under devices that the PCI is the right numbers, try changing the fglrx to vesa also. thats what i had to do 

fi that doesnt work change the aticonfig-Screen[0] under the screen area to "Default Screen" (dunno if that will do anyhting though.)

What's all that 0 business in your server section?
Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier     "Default Layout"
	Screen      0  "aticonfig-Screen[0]" 0 0

Also, why do you have two video drivers ?  You have aticonfig and ATI Technologies, Inc. RV350 AP [Radeon 9600] ?

But don't ask me.. I'm here because my video card has reverted to mesa again as well.
