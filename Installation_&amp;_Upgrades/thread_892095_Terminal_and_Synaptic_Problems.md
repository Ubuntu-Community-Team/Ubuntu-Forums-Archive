Does anyone know the fix to this?  It keeps me from using the Terminal to install, and I can't use Synaptic, or the Add/Remove at all.

```
E: Type '--21:55:33--' is not known on line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list
E: The list of sources could not be read.

```

Thanks!

Can you post the output of
```
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```
In terminal.

The problem is in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list , so we'll need to see that file. Please post the output of "cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/medibuntu.list"

 Did you fix the error? Because I can't see anything wrong here.
