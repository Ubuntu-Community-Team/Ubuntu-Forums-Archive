Hello,
I am planing on installing Kubuntu 11.04 on my laptop ( currently win 7 ). I want to have separate partitions for / and /home and a shared fat32 partition that both win and linux can read/write.

When i go to install using the manual option i get the partition table as follows:
sda 1 ntfs  size(208 ) used (69)
sda 2 ntfs  size(474389 ) used (51776)
sda 3 ntfs  size(25399 ) used (21683)
sda 4 fat32  size(108 ) used (33)

Now i know the big partition is the main win one, and the rest are recovery partitions and other crap that was pre installed on the machine ( hp ). So how do i go about making a new table with / , /home and shared fat32 - i want to split up sda2. The options are "new partition table","add","change" and "delete".

thanks:

You have a limitation that you can only have 4 primary partitions on an MBR partitioned disk.  Windows requires an MBR partitioned disk, so I usually suggest something like this:
