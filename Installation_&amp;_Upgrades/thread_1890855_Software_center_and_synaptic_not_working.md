Hi,

I installed Ubuntu in my asus eeepc and, after some months of use, both synaptic and software center stopped working. When I give the command sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade, this is what I get:
Malformed line 59 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)
E: The list of sources could not be read.
And then:

# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 11.04 _Natty Narwhal_ - Release i386 (20110427.1)]/ natty main restricted

# See [http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes](http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes) for how to upgrade to
# newer versions of the distribution.

Can someone help me?? I'm an absolute beginner! Thanks a lot!

Line 59 is the second-last line. And if you look carefully, you see that a space is missing. The line should be

```

deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner

```

just as the last line is also missing a space.

Try to change that by editing the file
```

sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

```

If that doesn't work, try puttin a #-symbol in front of those lines to comment those out.

Hi,

I tried both ways (space and #). It seems to work at first, but there is an error. This is what I get:

Reading package lists... Error!
E: Could not open file /var/lib/dpkg/status - open (2: No such file or directory)
E: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.

You're running Natty? You should remove the last two "lucid" lines, since mixing repositories from different distros can cause problems. ```
gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
``` When done run ```
sudo apt-get update
``` and if there are still errors please post them here.
