I installed Ubuntu 7.10 on a new laptop with a Realtek High Def sound card. The sound didn´t work but a sound card was detected since I was able to see the volume bar and other sound card related stuff.

I went to the Realtek website and downloaded the drivers. The install is failing but it managed to remove the old drivers and now the sound card is not recognized at all.

Here is the output of lspci:

No sound can be due to a multiplicity of problems, but I think you might find your answer here:

It half worked. I got back the sound card and the mixer, but there is still no sound.

Thanks for the help.

Thanks that helped a lot. I now have sound... The sound isn't too loud even when all the setting are maxed out in alsamixer (not as loud as with Vista for instance), but I am happy for now...
