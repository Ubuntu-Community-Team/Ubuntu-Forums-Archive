It says:

We're sorry; the installer crashed. Please file a bug report at [https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+filebug](https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+filebug) and a developer will attend to the problem as soon as possible. To help the developers understand what went wrong, include the following detail in your bug report, and attach the files /var/log/installer/syslog, /var/log/syslog, and /var/log/partman:
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "/usr/bin/ubiquity", line 130, in ?
    install(sys.argv[1])

    ret = wizard.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ubiquity/frontend/gtkui.py", line 264, in run
    self.progress_loop()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ubiquity/frontend/gtkui.py", line 538, in progress_loop
    raise RuntimeError, ("Install failed with exit code %s; see "
