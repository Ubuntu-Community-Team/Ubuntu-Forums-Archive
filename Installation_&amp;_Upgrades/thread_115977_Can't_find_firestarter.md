here's a copy of my sources.list:

deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 5.10 _Breezy Badger_ - Release i386 (20051012)]/ breezy main restricted

in the end of
```

```.

ok, so this line:

deb [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) breezy-updates main restricted 
should be:

deb [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) breezy-updates main restricted universe

and the next line should be:

deb-src [http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu) breezy-updates main restricted universe ?

well, i'm still missing something, cause synaptic still does not show firestarter in the available packages.

btw, synaptic also gives a warning box with this message:

There's a button labeled "Reload" in the upper left corner of Synaptic. Click it or press <Control>-R to fetch package lists.

Either that, or you are not connected to the internet.
