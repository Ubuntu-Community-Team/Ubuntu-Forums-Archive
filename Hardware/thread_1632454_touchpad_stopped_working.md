I'm using 10.10 on my laptop, and things seemed to be working fine, until today.  I've had a mouse plugged in for a couple of days, and now, for some reason, my touchpad doesn't seem to work.  

When ubuntu reaches the login page, I can move the cursor and tap with the touchpad, but as soon as I log in, the touchpad stops working.  

I've got "Pointing Devices" from the software center installed, and while it had previously worked without problems, now it won't start.  When I click the "Pointing Devices" icon in the menu, I see a label in the bottom panel saying "opening Pointing Devices" but nothing happens.

When I run synclient I get ```
josh@josh-dm4:~$ synclient -l
Parameter settings:
    LeftEdge                = 1752

    AreaTopEdge             = 0
    AreaBottomEdge          = 0
    JumpyCursorThreshold    = 0
```

and by toggling the "TouchPadOff" value I can get it to turn on.  However, because I usually use the laptop without a mouse, I'd like to find a way to get the touchpad working like it had been before.  Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance

I have the exact same problem. It will give me the "Starting Pointing Devices" prompt, then nothing.
