Hi, 

New to Ubuntu here.  I'm having an issue with the built-in webcam in a Thinkpad T400. It has been working spottily for about a month now (sometimes will work, sometimes won't). Using cheese, I can select the webcam in preferences as "Integrated Camera (/dev/video0), however, the output remains completely black and the light on the camera doesn't turn on (as it does when the camera is working).  I recently switched to Maverick Meerkat from Windows 7, and the same problem occurred there as well on Skype (which sometimes could be cured by rebooting).  I'd be tempted to chalk it up to simply a fault in the hardware, but the fact that it does work SOMETIMES suggests the camera itself is still working.   The following are outputs from lpsci and lusb:
