I have a Dell Inspiron 1564 with 2 operating systems Windows7 and Ubuntu 10.10, everything going nice, but I don't know how to configure my network card, because it's not detected.

There are many threads about this beast, as nearly everyone has problems with it. Search the forums or just get another miniPCIe card.
