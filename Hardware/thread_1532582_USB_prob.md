Hello everybody,

I've been trying to connect A usb flash drive to my laptop but the device can not be found or, recognized by the laptop. I need your help to solve this problem. I'm using UBUNTU 10.04 by the way.

I just started an account because of this very same issue. I installed Ubuntu 10.04 and everything seems to be going along ok. One major problem is I apparently have no usb support. I am running Ubuntu an an Acer Aspire 5100 lap top. When I plug in a usb device whether it's a flash disk or the dongle for my wireless mouse the  light blinks on and off once and nothing else happens. Are there any diagnostic tools to see if everything is loaded and functioning properly. The ports worked with the previous Windoze installation so I am confident it isn't a hardware issue. Thanks.

Paste the contents of your /etc/fstab file and the output of following command fdisk -l

The fdisk -l command didn't seem to return anything.

fdisk -l returns nothing is it???

Can you run df command and paste the output.

no prob dude

I just wanted to know what I'm supposed to do with the text you pasted on your reply.

---

### Post by vikas.sood on 2010-07-17
@exsoar: your usb drive is not getting mounted. so you need to manually mount it using the command line.

1. create a directory where you will mount. 
   cd /mnt
   sudo mkdir usbdrive

2. Mount the drive
   sudo mount -t <file-system-type> /dev/sdXY /mnt/usbdrive

   check your /dev directory to find out XY in the above command. Usually it should be sdb0 sdb1 for usb drives. sd identifies that its a SCSI disk, a or b identifies the drive number and finally 0, 1 2....identifies the partition on that drive. <file-system-type> is the file system on your usb drive eg. ext3, vfat ntfs etc..

@jack you can also try the steps above. 

All the mounted file systems can be seen by checking the contents of /etc/mtab file. 

The "none" in the df command output is a bit strange. Can anyone here through some light on it??

### Post by dandnsmith on 2010-07-17
exsoar:
you're not running the fdisk as root, so it won't give you info - do *sudo fdisk -l* to get partition info.

*lsusb* may divulge more info about the device and the port to which it is connected.

Still need some help.

### Post by lidex on 2010-07-18
Are you hooked up directly to a usb port or a separate hub? Try going direct. Try a different port. With device plugged in, run this command;
```
lsusb
```

---

### Post by vikas.sood on 2010-07-18
exsoar, you ran the command without connecting the usb drive to your computer.

plug in the usb and than run the command lsusb

---

### Post by exsoar on 2010-07-18
I have the devices plugged directly into the usb port. I have three ports on this lap top. I have 2 flash drives in 2 ports and a dongle for a wireless usb mouse, which also doesn't work by the way, in the third port. I have rotated the drives and dongle between each of the ports and nothing lights up or mounts. I have checked the bios and there is no place to setup or enable or disable the usb ports so I can only assume that they are always enabled as they worked when this was a windows machine.

oops. Check your xorg log and .conf
```
cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf
cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log
```

The first one is no surprise - the second I expect to see. Can you please use the lsusb command with the device plugged in?
Also this:
```
sudo dmidecode -t bios
```

Did you copy-and-paste the previous commands?

I had some terminal sabotage. I re-ran the second cat command and it returned this, sudo follows:
