Hey.

I recently went from being a full time Windows user to Kubuntu 10.10, everything works fine except for the sound. 
I've tried to purge pulseaudio, installed every ALSA package there is, and nothing works, read like 100 different threads and tried all methods. 
Anyone have a solution for this? 
It would be highly appreciated.

Here's the output from lspci:
