I have a problem with very dark picture from embedded video camera. It doesn't depend on application. It's dark in skype, cheese and others.
I can change brightness and other parameters in video4linux. It's not a solution cause it results with bad quality image (it's hard to adjust parameters).

OS: ubuntu 12.04 x64
