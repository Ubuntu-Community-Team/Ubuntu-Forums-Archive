softlockup beagled and cp and other file operations

I have been getting a softlockup on 61 seconds which, when on the console, I can see as reported as CPU0 and CPU1 / one has beagled's PID and the other, in the most recent case, a large 'cp' file.

The system is setup with two SATA300 drives 

sda1 boot
sda2 root
sda5 raid1 disk 1
sdb1 swap
sdb5 raid1 disk 2
md0 raid from disk 1 / disk 2

has not locked up in the last 3 days that beagle has be uninstalled
