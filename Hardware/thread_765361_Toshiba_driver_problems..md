I recently installed Ubuntu on a dual boot setup on my Toshiba A205 S4607.  Everything works fine except I have no sound and videos on youtube and the like do not work.  I've tried searching through the forums in an attempt to fix the problem, but could not find anything.

Regarding the sound issue, post the output of:

```
lspci
```

You have to install flash to watch YouTube videos. Download the "ubuntu-restricted-extras" for this, then restart your browser. 

All programs can be installed through Add/remove, Synaptic or "apt-get".

```
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
```
