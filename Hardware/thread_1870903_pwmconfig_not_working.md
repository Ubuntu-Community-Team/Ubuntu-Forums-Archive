title: "pwmconfig not working"

### Post by El_Matthews on 2011-10-28
My fancontrol isn't working anymore in my new installed Lucid 64Bit (MB: Asus P5KC)

When running sudo pwmconfig I get following message: ```
/usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed.
```

Strange, because this worked before with previous Ubuntu installations on the same hardware.

Anybody an idea why this is different in Lucid or is it a bug in Lucid 64bit?

sudo sensors-detect provides following output
```
mg@Ws-Ubu:~$ sudo sensors-detect
# sensors-detect revision 5818 (2010-01-18 17:22:07 +0100)

This program will help you determine which kernel modules you need
to load to use lm_sensors most effectively. It is generally safe
and recommended to accept the default answers to all questions,
unless you know what you're doing.

Some south bridges, CPUs or memory controllers contain embedded sensors.
Do you want to scan for them? This is totally safe. (YES/no):

Intel Core family thermal sensor...                         Success!
    (driver `coretemp')
Intel Atom thermal sensor...                                No
Intel AMB FB-DIMM thermal sensor...                         No
VIA C7 thermal sensor...                                    No
VIA Nano thermal sensor...                                  No

Some Super I/O chips contain embedded sensors. We have to write to
standard I/O ports to probe them. This is usually safe.
Do you want to scan for Super I/O sensors? (YES/no): 
Probing for Super-I/O at 0x2e/0x2f
Trying family `National Semiconductor'...                   No
Trying family `SMSC'...                                     No
Trying family `VIA/Winbond/Nuvoton/Fintek'...               Yes
Found `Winbond W83627DHG Super IO Sensors'                  Success!
    (address 0x290, driver `w83627ehf')
Probing for Super-I/O at 0x4e/0x4f
Trying family `National Semiconductor'...                   No
Trying family `SMSC'...                                     No
Trying family `VIA/Winbond/Nuvoton/Fintek'...               No
Trying family `ITE'...                                      No

Some systems (mainly servers) implement IPMI, a set of common interfaces
through which system health data may be retrieved, amongst other things.
We first try to get the information from SMBIOS. If we don't find it
there, we have to read from arbitrary I/O ports to probe for such
interfaces. This is normally safe. Do you want to scan for IPMI
interfaces? (YES/no): 
Probing for `IPMI BMC KCS' at 0xca0...                      No
Probing for `IPMI BMC SMIC' at 0xca8...                     No

Some hardware monitoring chips are accessible through the ISA I/O ports.
We have to write to arbitrary I/O ports to probe them. This is usually
safe though. Yes, you do have ISA I/O ports even if you do not have any
ISA slots! Do you want to scan the ISA I/O ports? (yes/NO): 

Lastly, we can probe the I2C/SMBus adapters for connected hardware
monitoring devices. This is the most risky part, and while it works
reasonably well on most systems, it has been reported to cause trouble
on some systems.
Do you want to probe the I2C/SMBus adapters now? (YES/no):

Now follows a summary of the probes I have just done.
Just press ENTER to continue: 

Driver `w83627ehf':
  * ISA bus, address 0x290
    Chip `Winbond W83627DHG Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 9)

Driver `adt7473':
  * Bus `NVIDIA i2c adapter '
    Busdriver `nvidia', I2C address 0x2e
    Chip `Analog Devices ADT7473' (confidence: 5)

Driver `coretemp':
  * Chip `Intel Core family thermal sensor' (confidence: 9)

To load everything that is needed, add this to /etc/modules:
#----cut here----
# Chip drivers
adt7473
coretemp
w83627ehf
#----cut here----
If you have some drivers built into your kernel, the list above will
contain too many modules. Skip the appropriate ones!

Do you want to add these lines automatically to /etc/modules? (yes/NO)

Unloading i2c-dev... OK
Unloading i2c-i801... OK

```

Just updating for reference. Please see [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1877114](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1877114) for solution. Adding 'acpi_enforce_resources=lax' to kernel solved the issue.
