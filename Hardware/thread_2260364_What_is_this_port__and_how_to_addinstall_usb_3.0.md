### Post by shantiq on 2015-01-11
i wish to install this on my 2005 Packard Bell PC   might as well since only £ 7 and will add 3.0 usb speed to system
[[IMG]http://s20.postimg.org/w6tnily8p/usb3_0card.jpg[/IMG]]("http://postimg.org/image/w6tnily8p/")

if you look at the red arrow PCI small socket here would it work or do i need a full size one
[[IMG]http://s20.postimg.org/vy0o6fau1/inside.jpg[/IMG]]("http://postimg.org/image/vy0o6fau1/")



now if the above is not an option to attach 3.0 usb card i was thinking that there is something here which looks antiquated and might be removed making one PCI available

i simply do not know what this is      see white arrow on earlier image pointing to what is on the inside
and see below what the port looks like on the outside    what is it?     can't find photos on the net     what does it do?     can i remove it?


question for serious techies amongst you
thanx for clever thoughts on this

I think you still have a modem installed for using dial-up networking over telephone lines, especially if the port only has 4 wire connection

Your mystery port looks like an old telephone modem connector. In the olden days, before cable and DSL, internet was delivered over a telephone modem that was connected to your computer through an RJ-11 cable. The current standard is to use an RJ-45 cable from either a cable or DSL modem. The RJ-11 jack looks similar to your ethernet, but is slightly smaller. The blue cable that is plugged into the back of your computer is an ethernet cable. I think the new card will install in the half slot that is available, but it might not be a bad idea to remove the old telephone modem card anyway.

Hope this helps!

thanx guys that covers it
of course 2005   telephone modems !!!

shall whip it out like an unwanted third gonad :}

but as you say fballem it might go in the half-slot anyhow

The little slot is PCI-E x1 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#PCI_Express_.28standard.29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#PCI_Express_.28standard.29)
The USB card would work in any PCI-E slot.

As for your question on the phone jack, you just made me feel like a dinosaur.

Hi, Shantiq.

I've just fitted one of these myself! Yours gives you 4 USB 3.0 ports, where mine only gives me two.....but that's enough for what I want. Apart from that, yours looks identical to mine; I picked mine up for £5 in Maplin's sale...

The card WILL fit ANY PCI-e slot, but will definitely fit the small slot you've indicated; that IS a PCI-e x1 slot, and your card WILL slot straight into it. The only thing you MIGHT need, is an extension 4-pin Molex lead, for connecting the card to the PSU; you will have spare 4-pin Molex connectors in the wiring loom, but they tend to be quite tightly bound together.....and they're NOT that long, anyway.

I picked up an extension lead for about £2.

Makes a BIG difference to your transfer speeds, I can tell you... Any probs with installing yours, just ask. It's pretty simple. But you MUST have the extra power connector, 'cos the PCIe slot will NOT provide enough power for all 4 ports. 1, yes; all 4, no way.

One tip; Give the slot a good blow out with a can of compressed air first, before you insert the card. If that slot has been unused for any length of time, you'd be amazed at the amount of fluff and dirt that can lodge in there.....and it DOESN'T help with good contact!

BTW: I've got the same set-up in my 10-yr old Compaq desktop.....still got a dial-up modem in there. I keep meaning to remove it, but never quite seem to get around to it..!


Regards,

Mike. ;)

thanx for extra info Mike and Temüjin 

ordered **eLifeStore® 4 Ports USB 3.0 PCIE PCI Express Card for PC with USB 3.0 Extension Cable (30CM), SuperSpeed 5.0Gbps**


from Amazon as went to Maplin's but they do not have the offer anymore   cheapest was £20     but got [COLOR=#000000]extension 4-pin Molex lead    now where does that go?   where i have placed a limegreen arrow?

Hi again, Shantiq.

No, you don't want to plug that in there! If I don't miss my guess, that looks like a mobo header power supply, possibly for SATA disks.....or maybe CMOS or BIOS jumper connectors (but that's not what you want.).

What you should have is a lead with one of these at each end:-

A 'Molex' 4-pin plug:

[ATTACH=CONFIG]259209[/ATTACH]

and a 'Molex' 4-pin socket:

[ATTACH=CONFIG]259210[/ATTACH]

These are usually about 6 inches long or so; you'll not find them any longer than this (something to do with the construction standards for such leads). If one doesn't reach, just buy two, and join them together, though in all fairness you shouldn't need to; your card WON'T be THAT far away..!

Your machine's about the same age as mine, and from what I can see of it, much of your setup looks identical, too.

If you follow the wiring loom from where it exits the PSU, and winds round the various components, as leads plug into various items, you SHOULD see a number of the 4-pin **plugs **poking out at various points. Plug the socket end of your extension lead into one of these, (preferably the one closest to the card!), and then the plug end into the socket on the board (that's the white plastic 'box' on the corner of the card). They require quite a firm push to seat fully, as these rely on a friction fit, rather than 'latches' to secure them.

That's all there is to it, after you've removed the slot guard from the back of the case, and plugged the card itself into the PCIe x1 socket that you've got. You can safely remove that old modem, since you've got broadband anyway.....it works off a completely different set of circuits to the modem. Shouldn't hurt at all.

BTW: I picked mine up at that price from one of the 'bargain' baskets they have scattered around the store at sale time. As you say, they DO have some new ones in now, at £20.....but that's a wee bit pricey for what they are..! Most of these are designed to work off the PCIe 2.0 standard; mine's the older 1.1 standard, so it's not getting the full 5 GBps transfer speed, as the 1.1 didn't support that kind of speed.....but it's still a hell of a lot quicker than standard USB 2.0 (480 MBps); I think I'm getting somewhere between 1.5 - 2 GBps instead, but I'm QUITE happy with that, for £7-worth of parts, and 5 minutes work!

Let us know how you get on, please.


Regards,

Mike. ;)

> got extension 4-pin Molex lead now where does that go? where i have placed a limegreen arrow?

The green arrow points to a mobo header where you would connect an expansion bracket (it could be a USB header, serial header, Firewire header, etc.). Example: [http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=D1675-CBL](http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=D1675-CBL)
Based on the age of your mobo, there's no way it's a USB 3.0 header though (that's why you need a PCI-e card).

BTW, if you can fit a Molex connector in there, that's a picture I'd like to see :P

I concur. The USB 3.0 standard didn't come out until 2009/10. This is the article I referenced when adding my shopping list of bits together:-

[http://www.howtogeek.com/199461/the-htg-guide-to-upgrading-your-computer-to-usb-3.0/](http://www.howtogeek.com/199461/the-htg-guide-to-upgrading-your-computer-to-usb-3.0/)

How-to-Geek is a good, no-nonsense, no bulls**t site that I find gives good, impartial advice.

Mike. :D

again thank you.  will say how it all goes when it arrives :]

### Post by shantiq on 2015-01-16
[B]Update

[/B]arrived and installed   went for the small PCI in the end and removed redundant Dial-up port anyhow

tried USB 3.0 sd card reader and tried 3GB transfer and see no speed increase really

then tried a DANEELEC  8GB memory stick   and again tested 4GB    and no increase either


could it be i need to wait for the 3.0 Memory stick ordered to see speed increase



could it also be i have not pushed the molex deep in enough    see   photo    it only went a little way in    do i need to push more forcefully  or is it ok as is if you can judge by photo

Hi again, Shantiq.

First things first; from what I can see of it, the Molex connector looks to be fine. Remember what I told you about these connectors; they work purely on a friction fit (what some might call an 'interference' fit); as long as it's pushed in as far as you can get it, it's good. The socket connectors are 'spring-loaded', anyway; they spring open, to ensure a tight fit as the pins in the plug push in.

As far as the transfer rates go, you won't see a speed increase until & unless you actually use it with a USB 3.0 peripheral. USB 2.0 transfer rates top out at about 480 MB/s or so;
 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#2.0)

As I understand it, the firmware inside the stick itself won't permit transfer at a higher rate than this. So, to answer your question, yes; you WILL need to wait until your USB 3.0 stick arrives. And remember; you probably won't get the full 5 GB/s that USB 3.0 is capable of delivering, since by their very nature, flash drives simply cannot transfer data as quickly as either a hard drive, or a SSD. You should, however, see quite an increase over a USB 2.0 stick..!

I purchased mine because the external Seagate 'Expansion' drive that I bought back in March last year is USB 3.0 standard. I keep an awful lot of data on there which I access on quite a regular basis, and I knew the Seagate was capable of letting me access that data at a substantially higher rate than I was getting. I don't know exactly what I'm getting from mine, but I can transfer a 3 GB folder of data in about 1 minute and 30, 35 secs or so.....where previously it would take the best part of 10 minutes to do it. So that's a substantial increase.

Like I said, for the cost of a pack of ciggies and about 5 mins work, I'm very pleased with the results!

Hope that helps.


Regards,

Mike. :)

Some commands to verify hardware status (maybe share output of lspci and lsusb commands):
```
sudo update-pciids
sudo update-usbids
lspci -k | egrep -i 'usb|hci'
sudo lsusb -v
```

I've run those commands through myself, Shantiq (thanks, Temujin!); like you, I too am now getting references to SuperSpeed USB 3.0, which I'm sure weren't there before.

My guess is that the kernel has had USB 3.0 root hub support for some years (and several versions!), but you and I have only now accessed them by fitting the expansion cards.....

Just my observations on the matter.


Regards,

Mike.

### Post by shantiq on 2015-01-17
Yes Mike fully in accordance with your last post observation

Interestingly apparently Linux was streets ahead in installing the usb 3.0 drivers in the kernel in relation to Windows and Mac

[B]> [COLOR=#333333][FONT=UbuntuRegular]Linux started supporting USB 3.0 in the September 2009 release of the 2.6.31 kernel, and Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala was the first version of Ubuntu to support USB 3.0.[/FONT][/COLOR]
[/B]
[from]("http://askubuntu.com/questions/12139/does-ubuntu-support-usb-3-0")


whereas and i may be wrong here but it seems both Windows and Mac reading around require to this day added drivers to start those off


Nice to hear Linux was/is on the ball first in this area
