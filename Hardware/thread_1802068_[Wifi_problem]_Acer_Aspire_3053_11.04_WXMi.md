Today I installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my Acer Aspire 3053  WXMi. I'm having problems with wifi, as there is no network detected. To connect my PC via wifi I had to select the option "connect to a wifi hidden" by entering user and pass of the my wifi . Now I noticed that the connection is not always successful. Someone help me know, thanks in advance from a noob
