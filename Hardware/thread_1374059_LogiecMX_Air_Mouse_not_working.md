Hi,

I purchased a MX Air mouse (Logitech) and it does not work at all on my Asrock Ion330 nettop with Karmic (not one button, appears to be connecting to the USB receiver), I am also using a Logitech wireless keyboard with accompanying normal mouse, which both worked perfectly out of the box. 

I have done lots of forum searches and it seems to me that just about everyone user, said that it worked for them out of the box with Ubuntu. So I am wondering if this is a product fault and I should return it to a Logitech dealer or otherwise some forum member could possibly guide me through a solution, that would solve the problem if possible.

SO far I have tried seeing if it works by disconnecting my other USB receiver, by pointing directly 1 foot away from the receiver, but still nothing.

Not sure what info would help you, but just in case its of use I am putting the following terminal script:

Have reported this to the Logitech Customer Service, and following their over the phone tests it still did not work even on Windows 7 and XP. So I am awaiting news from them on how they can replace it.
