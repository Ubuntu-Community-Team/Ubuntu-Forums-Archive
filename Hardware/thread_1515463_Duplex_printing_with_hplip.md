title: "Duplex printing with hplip"

Hi all

I'm really enjoying my ubuntu experience. The single problem I have is that duplex printing is always greyed out in every single application.
Using a HP F4580 officejet with latest version of HPLIP.
Using Windows I can always print duplex.

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance

Note: I am not longer on the HPLIP team. But, I'll try and help.

Run hp-check (in terminal) and post the output.

Thanks!

Thank you very much...
Here it is...

This is free software, and you are welcome to distribute it
under certain conditions. See COPYING file for more details.

Note: hp-check can be run in three modes:
1. Compile-time check mode (-c or --compile): Use this mode before compiling the
HPLIP supplied tarball (.tar.gz or .run) to determine if the proper dependencies
are installed to successfully compile HPLIP.                                    
2. Run-time check mode (-r or --run): Use this mode to determine if a distro    
supplied package (.deb, .rpm, etc) or an already built HPLIP supplied tarball   
has the proper dependencies installed to successfully run.                      
3. Both compile- and run-time check mode (-b or --both) (Default): This mode    
will check both of the above cases (both compile- and run-time dependencies).
