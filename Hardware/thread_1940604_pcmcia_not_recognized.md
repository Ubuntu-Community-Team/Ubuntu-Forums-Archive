This is what I get when I enter lspci
Could someone tell me if my pcmcia slot is recognized?  It does not register.  However the SD slot just under the pc card slot does.
Puppy does recognize the slot and the compact flash in the pcmcia adapter.

If I need a driver, where would I get one?

Thanks very Much. Mary:)
