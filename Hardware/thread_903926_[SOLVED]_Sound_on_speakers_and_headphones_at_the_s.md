please post the output of the lspci command, and we'll find out which soundcard do you have.

hi birbam,

have you got the "headphone jack sense" set?

had the same issue with a HP nc8000. basic i know but ya gotta start somewhere.

open the volume control and enter the switches tab and it might be there and unchecked.


cheers

Adding 
#options snd-hda-intel model=mitac
options snd-hda-intel model=3stack-6ch

to alsa-utils in modprobe.d Also
        amixer set 'Capture' cap

My mic is still muted, any other ideas?
