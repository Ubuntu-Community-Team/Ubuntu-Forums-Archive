Hi,
I am trying to install Ubuntu on my HP HDX18T. I have the model with the full size keyboard (qwerty and a numpad).

However, The keyboard doesn't work once ubuntu boots from the livecd, OR after HD installed, I have to use an external. No caps lock light, or anything.

But, on the first screen after the livecd loads, where I choose Try ubuntu... It works there.

Not sure if this helps, but lspci 's output:

Also, when the computer is shutting down and is back in the B+W text screen, the keyboard works again. But, if I switch to a terminal with ctrl-alt-f1, it doesn't work there.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
