title: "Problem with memory bandwidth"

So I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I was curious if this is a problem, and if so, how do I solve it?

I have tried to watch 1080p movies with my laptop and they are choppy sometimes so I looked at the processor usage with the system monitor.  Both of them run at about 90% and hit 100% once in a while.  Btw I'm watching the movie through vlc.  I decided to look into my video card as well and so I opened the Catalyst Control Center and under information it says that my memory type is DDR3 at 800 MHz with 256 MB but the bandwidth is 0.0 GByte/s.  I was wondering if this is correct or maybe a driver or something was installed incorrectly?

Here are my laptop specs:
lenovo T400
Ati radeon 3470
Core 2 duo P8700
10.10 Maverick

that is a high CPU load, It is also most likely why the playback is so choppy.

run these commands (as your normal user), to check if your configuration is correct. here is my example results.
(G34, magny-cours 8x, Opteron w/ ATI HD 5670) 

Check if your HW-Accel is correctly configured, and your not failing to mesa software rendering.
```

$ fglrxinfo 
display: :0.0  screen: 0
OpenGL vendor string: ATI Technologies Inc.
OpenGL renderer string: ATI Radeon HD 5670
OpenGL version string: 4.1.10524 Compatibility Profile Context

```  

Check if the XV subsystem is working, so your video can run w/ hardware overlay.
```

Also, the VLC fanboyz are gonna kill me but...., 
you might want to consider mplayer.  It can be a slight pain to configure but it is worth it for performance (IMO)

if you do the mplayer route, make sure install the [medibuntu repo](http://medibuntu.org/repository.php) before installing the package. (full none-free codecs)

My output seems to be pretty similar to yours.  

I actually have mplayer installed but I haven't configured it.  I have played the 1080p movie with it as well and the cpu usage is more around 60%, which makes the viewing smoother.  I was just curious though why my memory bandwidth is 0.

Your output looks correct, as far as Xv is concerned.  You also will want to check if your media player is set for Xv as its video output mode.

I too use mplayer, as I found it to be the best performing.  It also is very flexible.  If you already installed mplayer, try running the video with

```
mplayer -vo xv video_file.avi
```

You also could try doing it without sound, to narrow down the bottle neck.

```
mplayer -vo xv -nosound video_file.avi
```

You could also possibly look at using the [http://medibuntu.org/](http://medibuntu.org/) repos.
