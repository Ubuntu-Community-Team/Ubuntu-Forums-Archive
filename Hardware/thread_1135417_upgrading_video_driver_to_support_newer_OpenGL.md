Hiya, i have been trying to troubleshoot a game ([http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1135320](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1135320)) and prem1er eventually found that it was my video driver not supporting OpenGL 2.+.

The card itself can support it, its just the video driver.

The laptop itself is Fujitsu Siemens Esprimo Mobile V5055

here is the output from lspci:

and the output from glxinfo | grep "OpenGL"
