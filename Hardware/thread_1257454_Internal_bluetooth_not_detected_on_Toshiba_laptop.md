Hi there,

My Toshiba laptop has an internal bluetooth module that isn't being detected by Ubuntu 9.04. I believe the key combination to turn on/off bluetooth is Fn + F8, but this doesn't seem to do anything at all.

Here is my output of lspci:

According to Toshiba, my bluetooth is called "Toshiba BluetoothTM V2.0 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)"


I read somewhere on the internet after a google search that if bluetooth was disabled in windows and then windows was replaced by Ubuntu without it being re-enabled in windows first, then it was impossible to start the device so Ubuntu can find it... surely this cannot be true, if windows can start/stop devices, Ubuntu must be able to as well.

I had the same problem on a satellite pro A300-1RW, for what i read around it is not possible to turn bluetooth on/off because of the bios. So I solved the situation by booting into windows and with the toshiba software turn it on.

After you boot in linux and you'll see the bluetooth icon.

It was the only solution i found and that i used.

Best regards
