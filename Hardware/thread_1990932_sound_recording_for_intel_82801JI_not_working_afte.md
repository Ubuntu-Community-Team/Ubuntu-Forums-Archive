title: "sound recording for intel 82801JI not working after 12.04 upgrade"

### Post by akos.maroy on 2012-05-30
I have an intel 82801JI audio chip on my motherboard, which can't record sound after upgrading to ubuntu 12.04. while on ubuntu 11.10, it could record sound.

I can see the audio input device via the audio settings menu, and also with alsamixer, but no input would come in. I've tested with two microphones, with plugged in both into the mic and line-in inputs. I've tested recording with the ubuntu audio recorder tool, and also with skype - none of them record any sound, and the input level is 0 on the audio mixer panel.

playback works fine

any advice on how to get this working again welcome...

Hello,
Please read the following posting. It might help you to test the audio (input) devices.
See: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/audio-recorder/+bug/1009930](https://bugs.launchpad.net/audio-recorder/+bug/1009930) (answer #1)

actually, the issue is 'fixed' by adding the following module option into /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf :

options snd-hda-intel model=intel-x58

see also [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1006258](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1006258)

but, this used to 'just work' and now it doesn't :(
