Anybody know if it's possible to install 12.04 on UEFI? What is a fake msdos. I'm putting in install-CD and selecting Install Ubuntu and it always stops with the  fake msdos message. 

I set no partitions, no dual-boot. Entire disk for ubuntu 12.04.

I installed via a USB thumb drive. I believe I had to boot it in EFI mode (an option in the BIOS boot menu). From there, I did custom partitions, and the first partition I created was a 40MB EFI partition. Everything else was standard setup.

Just about everyone that has gotten UEFI to work has partitioned in advance with gpt partitions. Not sure what fakemsdos is as MBR is msdos, but normally UEFI does not install to MBR in UEFI mode but in the old BIOS mode. Different vendors call the old BIOS mode different things.

Examples that worked, format in advanced with gparted, gpt with find efi output & demesg

If drive is only going to be Ubuntu (never Windows), I would suggest using gpt not MBR as the partitioning scheme. You then do not have any logical partitions, they are all primary and it has a backup in case of problems. You do have to create a tiny bios_grub partition to correctly install grub2's boot loader to the drive.
If using gpt with BIOS create a 1MB bios_grub partition with no format. I used gparted and selected gpt under device, advanced & select gpt over msdos(MBR) default partitioning....

Since the BIOS Boot Partition ("bios_grub" flag set in GNU Parted) is used without a filesystem for storing GRUB 2 boot code, and since the EFI System Partition (ESP) is used by EFI with a FAT-32 filesystem for storing EFI files, the two cannot be the same partition.
If you're using UEFI mode to boot, you don't need a BIOS Boot Partition, but you do need an EFI System Partition (ESP)
If a new drive, to be safe, create both of these partitions, in addition to your regular Linux partitions. But the efi partition has to be first. Do not configure Linux to use either the ESP or the BIOS Boot Partition; they'll be used automatically by GRUB, if necessary.

If you're using UEFI mode to boot, you don't need a BIOS Boot Partition with gpt partitions (only for BIOS), but you do need an EFI System Partition (ESP). This is entirely different; it should be a 200-300 MiB FAT32 partition that's flagged as an ESP and must be the first partition. In libparted-based tools, you'd give it a "boot" flag (which is entirely unrelated to the MBR boot/active flag, although libparted makes them look the same). In gdisk, you'd give it a type code of EF00.
An EFI System Partition EF00 (~100 to -256MiB, FAT32) for UEFI, a BIOS Boot Partition EF02 (~1MiB, no filesystem) for BIOS, and whatever partitions you want for Linux. You must set the partition type codes correctly, but how you do this depends on the utility you use to create them. Also, you should be sure to create a GUID Partition Table (GPT) on the disk, not a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. In BIOS mode, Ubuntu's installer defaults to creating MBR partitions, at least on sub-1TB disks, so you may need to use another utility to do the partitioning. You do not need both but it does not hurt as both are small, and then you can configure easily to boot with either UEFI or BIOS. You can boot via bios AND efi (after setting up your efi boot entry using efibootmgr or via efi shell and running the efi binary)
AsRock calls BIOS mode AHCI.


In GPT fdisk, ESPs have a type code of EF00. In libparted-based tools, you mark the ESP as such by setting its "boot flag." Note that the libparted "boot flag" means something entirely different under MBR, and you should not set the "boot flag" on any OS partition under GPT!

Hmm. Looks like I'm going to have to use LIVE cd to install the ESP partition and then run the installer. See if this works.

When I was trying to install, the Ubuntu message asked me if I'm trying to use GPT. Which I was. But it never let me advance past that screen. I'll try write down the message and post it here when I get time.

This is getting complicated. Hopefully this will get fixed in Quetzel so users can just install to UEFI from the default CD without having to do all these hacks so it will work. Win8 is mandating UEFI. so peple buying new computers that don't know much ain't going to get Ubuntu installed on their box
