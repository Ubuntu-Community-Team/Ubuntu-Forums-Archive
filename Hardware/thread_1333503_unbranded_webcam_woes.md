Hi there

I recently bought a cam that the seller assured me was UVC compliant, its came with a cd that i cannot access as i don't have windows.
So i compiled and installed the UVC drivers from [http://linuxtv.org/hg/~pinchartl/uvcvideo/shortlog/tip]("http://linuxtv.org/hg/%7Epinchartl/uvcvideo/shortlog/tip")
following the instructions from [//https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UVC]("http://ubuntuforums.org//https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UVC")

But still nor cheese or skype, lsusb detect the webcam.

here's the output from lsusb

> Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 005: ID 1b3b:2936  
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
I don't really know where to start looking for drivers, the only info i've got from the driver cd is the directory name /media/cdrom0/USB 2.0 PC Camera (60Hz)_080323_WHQL.exe 

Here's the output from dmesg

Any clues??

Hi corky383,

I feel your pain - I just bought the same.

Try updating usb ids like this: -

```

# **update-usbids.sh **

I tried  that command but it was not recognised, is there something i should install first?
> sudo: update-usbids.sh: command not found


Also do you know why the lsusb actually registers the webcam as "Bus 002 Device 002: ID 1b3b:2936" even though its not actually usable

### Post by chrisp_duck on 2009-11-26
Try the full path: -

```

/usr/sbin/update-usbids.sh

```AFAIK, when you insert a USB device its connection alone is enough to get it shown in lsusb and the fact that it has/had no proper description, is because it is newer or less well supported by the USB and device drivers.

The same goes for PCI devices.  If the device is rare or newer than the most likely driver, then it's unlikely to work without some "tweaking" of the driver.

I've seen really new network cards which don't work with latest driver but the code in svn/cvs works or you can just be sneaky and get away with adding the new USB/PCI IDentifier into the current driver and re-make it (a bit beyond me nowadays so any help from the community would be appreciated)...

Maybe I'm not past it...  I'll have a go and see if I can install the v4l development files and see what I can do.  I'll keep you informed...

OK, so it's probably in the UVC video drivers and I've downloaded from here [http://linuxtv.org/hg/~pinchartl/uvcvideo/shortlog/tip]("http://linuxtv.org/hg/%7Epinchartl/uvcvideo/shortlog/tip"), extracted the .tar.gz and went a looking for what I think I want...

I know there's one camera out there from the same 'idVendor" (1b3b), (I got more info about the device from 'lsusb -v -s 4:16'), so I search for that string in the files: -

> 
chrisp:~/Downloads/uvcvideo-26d3049cb825 % **grep -r -i "1b3b" ***  
**linux/drivers/media/video/uvc/uvc_driver.c**:      .idVendor        = 0x**1b3b**,
Looking inuvc_driver.c it looks like there is a "catch-all" that should make any device that states that its "Device Class" is "USB_CLASS_VIDEO", but our device states that its class is "Defined at Interface level" and at the interface level it says "Vendor Specific Class".

I edited uvc_driver.c and copied the following code: -

```

        /* MSI StarCam 370i */
        { .match_flags          = USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_DEVICE
                                | USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_INT_INFO,
          .idVendor             = 0x1b3b,
          .idProduct            = 0x2951,
          .bInterfaceClass      = USB_CLASS_VIDEO,
          .bInterfaceSubClass   = 1,
          .bInterfaceProtocol   = 0,
          .driver_info          = UVC_QUIRK_PROBE_MINMAX },

```creating a new block at the bottom of the list, just above the catch-all, containing details of our device: -

```

        /* iPassion Technology Inc. PC Camera/Webcam controller */
        { .match_flags          = USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_DEVICE
                                | USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_INT_INFO,
          .idVendor             = 0x1b3b,
          .idProduct            = 0x2936,
          .bInterfaceClass      = USB_CLASS_VIDEO,
          .bInterfaceSubClass   = 1,
          .bInterfaceProtocol   = 0,
          .driver_info          = UVC_QUIRK_PROBE_MINMAX },
        /* Generic USB Video Class */
        { USB_INTERFACE_INFO(USB_CLASS_VIDEO, 1, 0) },
        {}

```Actually I edited a copy of the file so I could do a diff like this: -

```

```I now wonder if anyone who knows their stuff can tell me how to "make" this or otherwise test it, so we can see if it does the trick?

I had a bit of confusion yesterday, when I waws trying to figure out which of my cams was in which USB port and I managed to accidentally find out that this iPassion camera works OK, by swapping it with another camera in a different port.  It must have been using the other camera's resource and driver.  I live in hope that the uvcvideo driver is updated soon...

I have one of these webcams too.  I found this bug report about it: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/489149](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/489149)
I put a link to this forum thread in the bug report in the hope that someone who knows what they're doing will find your patch here.

Hi, I downloaded uvcvideo-26d3049cb825 tried to build a patched version as chrisp_duck suggests, but running make at the uvcvideo source tree I get the following errors:

```

```

I have installed linux-headers-2.6.31-15-generic that match my running kernel. 

Can anyone help out with those missing header files?

### Post by gmjohnston on 2009-12-01
Hi, ktogias,
Same here, even after I downloaded the entire kernel source.

I cannot find those headers as well, but you can disable the building of firedtv:

1) sudo make menuconfig
2) DVB drivers --> Unmark firedtv

Best regards.

I'm not sure if this applies to the iPassion 2936, but here's my experience with a no-name iPassion 2937 based camera.

Here's the relevant lsusb entry: 

```
Bus 002 Device 018: ID 1b3b:2937 iPassion Technology Inc. PC Camera/Webcam controller
```

I tried the above suggestion and patched the uvcvideo module with appropriate entries for my camera. The patched module did recognize the camera as an allegedly supported device, but failed to find the expected uvc usb descriptors during the probing stage.

I'm not a usb programmer, but I did look at the uvc specs and compared it with what I could understand from the usb descriptors returned by the 2937 and I'm convinced that the 2937 is NOT a uvc device. I'm not sure if this applies to the 2936, but here's the verbose lsusb output. If the output from a 2936 looks similar, chances are it won't work either with the uvc driver. (I haven't tried to find out if it might work with another driver, I just gave up and bought a Logitech.)
