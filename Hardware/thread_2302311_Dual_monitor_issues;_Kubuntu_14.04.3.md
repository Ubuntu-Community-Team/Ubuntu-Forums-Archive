title: "Dual monitor issues; Kubuntu 14.04.3"

Hi,

I'm at my wits end with my dual-monitor setup - any advice would be greatly appreciated, apologies if I have missed anything out.

I am running Kubuntu 14.04.3, and I have two identical Dell U2414H screens, which should work at 1920x1080. My dual-monitor setup was working fine up until a couple of weeks ago, when suddenly the left monitor's resolution decreased to 1024x768. (the right monitor remained at 1920x1080.) The higher resolutions were no longer available on my left monitor under "display settings".

I have tried installing fglrx, but this broke the graphics (upon booting, I was required to start in "low graphics mode"). I followed the instructions at [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/VideoDriverDetection#Problem:_Need_to_purge_-fglrx](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/VideoDriverDetection#Problem:_Need_to_purge_-fglrx) to go back to the open source drivers. My left monitor now stays in sleep mode, so presumably it's getting no signal.

I swapped the monitors around (i.e. plugged each one into the other graphics card), and found that the low resolution remained on the same monitor. I would therefore assume it was an EDID issue, but I'm not sure, because the dual monitor setup works fine in Windows.

Output from various commands follows:

No takers? Sad times.

I tried specifying my X config explicitly:

/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/01myXorg.conf
```

Section "Device"
    Identifier "CardA"
    Driver "radeon"
    BusID "PCI:1@0:0:0"
EndSection

Section "Device"
    Identifier "CardB"
    Driver "radeon"
    BusID "PCI:5@0:0:0"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
    Identifier "MonitorA"
    Modeline "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
    Identifier "MonitorB"
    Modeline "1920x1080_60.00"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "ScreenA"
    Device "CardA"
    Monitor "MonitorA"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
    Identifier "ScreenB"
    Device "CardB"
    Monitor "MonitorB"
EndSection

#Section "ServerLayout"
#    Identifier "MyLayout"
#    Screen "ScreenA"
#    Screen "ScreenB" LeftOf "ScreenA"
#EndSection

```

note the commented-out "ServerLayout" section, which, if included, causes the computer to boot in low-graphics mode.

Now, when I open "Display Configuration", it specifies exactly the configuration I want:

[ATTACH=CONFIG]265766[/ATTACH]

 Unfortunately, the left-hand monitor is now black. It's on, but presumably just not receiving any input.

Xorg.0.log now goes like this:

Me too, Comparing and Contrasting:

Similarities
  Ubuntu 14.04.3 (actually, not Kubuntu)
  Xeon E3-1200

Differences
  I can't get my monitor to show at all
  My lshw shows one display, not two
  I don't have the same monitors
I hope it will get better when I try to use a different adaptor, and DVI instead of VGA.

I wonder if your graphics card has a hardware problem but I have no idea how I would test it.  Good luck.

i would say clean up the various config files and try with fglrx again. : [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/AMD](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/AMD)

also if previously worked try booting into older kernel to see if it is a kernel issue. if it is, then a bug report should be filed so someone can fix it.
