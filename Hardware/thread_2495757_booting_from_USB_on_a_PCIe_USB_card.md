title: "booting from USB on a PCIe USB card"

Genetrally speaking,
**would a USB extension card in a PCIe allow booting?**

Just looking for an educated guess.
Nothing too critical.

Explanation:
- an ancient desktop PC works extremely well
- boots fine from any USB 1 - 2 - 3 storage (pen drives, SATA on USB adapters)
- some USB interfaces (which are USB 1 and USB 2) seem growingly unreliable
- mobo has a free PCIe slot
- other than the USB interfaces I can't find anything remotely wrong with this comp.

I am tempted to install a PCIe card with extra USB interfaces.

I am sure the will work fine once the comp is running,
but I wonder if it would be reasonable to expect that
the comp might boot from these US interfaces too.

My guess is, it should.

Chips on the card would be right on the PCI bus just like the chips that serve the USB 2 interfaces.

Any comments?
Will rephrase post if necessary.

Apparently it is on UEFI systems as discussed at the Intel site, link below.
