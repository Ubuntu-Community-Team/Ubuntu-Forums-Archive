I upgraded to 12.04 several months ago and everything was working well.  Last week the Elantech touchpad stopped working after login - still works before login.  My USB mouse works and the touchpad works in W7.  I also have Mint 13 installed for evaluation and the same happened with Mint - touchpad will not work after login.
