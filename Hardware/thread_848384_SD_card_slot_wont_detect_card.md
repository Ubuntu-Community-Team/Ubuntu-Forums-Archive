Im running ubuntu hardy (8.04), and everyhting is working fine now (i was even able to fix the issue of the flash player taking off my sound xD). So yesterday i went on a trip with some friends and took many pictures. When i came home, i tried to insert my SD card in the computers slot to transfer the pictures to my computer. When the card was inserted, the blue button of the slot started to flash, but the card was never detected. My computer is an hp pavillion dv6646us. If anyone has any information on how to fix this problem, it will be really appreciated. I read something about updating the kernell fixing this issue, but i dont know anything about kernells, and didnt want to mess up with it.

Here is a thread dealing with the Ricoh card readers.

If that does not work then get a USB SD/xD card reader.  They can be had on ebay for under $10.
