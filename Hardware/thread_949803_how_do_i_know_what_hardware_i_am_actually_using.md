### Post by scooterpd on 2008-10-16
i am trying to figure out what kind of hardware i actually use on my hp dv800t laptop.  i would like to remove modules for stuff i dont use, such as pcmcia and expresscard slots, firewire, anything ide or pata, etc.  i know that i need usb, sd card reader, sata for my hdd, my network controller(intel 3945 wireless), but i dont know anything about the numerous pci bridges and what they do?  

i have tried to interpret the following terminal commands, but i still dont know what i actually need and what i just have built into the laptop.

is there any command that would tell me what ports are currently active?
any help would be greatly appreciated.
