Hi!

I use my printer at the first time in Ubuntu 11.04, it is a Konica Minolta PagePro 1350W. There weren't any problem with the driver, when i plugged in the USB port, it recognized it, and downloaded the driver.

After pressing the PRINT button, it prints only 2 pages, after that the "error" and "ready" LED is blinking on the printer. I think that means that it went to sleep mode, and I don't know why. If I print the documents in pieces, like every piece is just 2 page, then it is okay... 

There wasn't any problem like this in windowsXP, so there isn't any bad things with the printer.

I am not a proskilled Ubuntu user :), but I want to be.

UPDATE
The problem is still in Ubuntu 11.10.

My cupsd.conf is like that:
```

Hello

I had the same problem and I wonder if U solved it and how?

I've omitted it by changing the printing options. Not sure which exactly made a difference, but I guess that reversing the output order or setting the job priority to 100.

I had the same problem. I fixed it by setting correct output format - in my case to A4.
