I'm at my end with this stupid microphone. :(
I have a Cyber Acoustics headset, with a microphone.
I plug them in the back of my computer, and I get the headphone working by turning up the "Side", but I cannot get my microphone to record!
I've tried turning up all of the options (even going into Pref. and enabling everything)

All there is; is silence, while other options give me a loud buzzing / crackling noise.

Can anyone please help me?  I want to speak to other people through games, I don't want to be silent anymore!  :lolflag:

Anyone have an idea?
I really want to be able to talk to people on TF2.
Getting it working in Linux is the first step!  :lolflag:
