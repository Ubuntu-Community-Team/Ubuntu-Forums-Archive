I'm running Precise on an HP G62-367dx that is stock other than an upgrade from 4 to 8 GB memory about a week ago.

I finally received my Raspberry pi and am trying to load the operating system on the SD card. I'm pretty sure the card reader worked before, though I won't swear to it, but I seem to recall using it. Now, nothing. I put the card into the reader, the reader does not pick it up.

Here's the readout from lspci:
```

```

Any ideas?

Could be a problem with the card itself. I have one card that I can't get to work with my card reader, but the card reader works well with other cards. The card itself doesn't show any issues when it is in the camera, but simply doesn't work in the reader. Have you tried another card in that reader?

That's exactly what it was, my SD card had gone bad, not a problem with the computer or Precise. Thanks for the help!
