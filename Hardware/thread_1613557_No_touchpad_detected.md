Hi to all,

I just unboxed my new sony vaio vpceb3c5e (e series) and immediatly installed ubuntu 10.10.

My problem is that the touchpad doesn't work: no movements, no click, nothing. Same during installation process.

I tried xinput --list and this is the result:
```

&#9121; Virtual core pointer                    	id=2	[master pointer  (3)]
&#9116;   &#8627; Virtual core XTEST pointer              	id=4	[slave  pointer  (2)]
&#9116;   &#8627; Logitech USB Receiver                   	id=11	[slave  pointer  (2)]
&#9123; Virtual core keyboard                   	id=3	[master keyboard (2)]
    &#8627; Virtual core XTEST keyboard             	id=5	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    &#8627; Sony Vaio Keys                          	id=6	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    &#8627; Video Bus                               	id=7	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    &#8627; Power Button                            	id=8	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    &#8627; USB 2.0 Camera                          	id=9	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    &#8627; Logitech USB Receiver                   	id=10	[slave  keyboard (3)]
    &#8627; AT Translated Set 2 keyboard            	id=12	[slave  keyboard (3)]

```

Thanks to everyone in advance for your help!
