I'm trying to burn an Ubuntu 13.10 Desktop image to a DVD+R using Brasero, but I get the following error every time
```

SCSI error on write(0,16): [3 73 03] Medium error. Power calibration area error.

```

I've tried changing the write speed (changed it from max to 6x), and different DVD's, but nothing helps. 

I changed my /etc/fstab so the part about the drive looks like this
```

/dev/disk/by-id/ata-PBDS_DVD+_-RW_DH-16W1S /mnt/ata-PBDS_DVD+_-RW_DH-16W1S auto noauto 0 0

```

Does anyone know what could cause this?

Here is the log file from Brasero

This means that the drive cannot adjust its laser intensity so that the burned data are properly readable. This can either be caused by faulty media, or by a drive that is going bad.  The failure with several media indicates that the problem might sit in the drive. Did you already try DVD types other than DVD+R ?

I tried a DVD-R, and that wouldn't mount at all, even though the drive says it's DVD+/-RW. It's a old machine, so I guess it's just the drive going bad.
