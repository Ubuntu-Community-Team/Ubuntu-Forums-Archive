Hi!

I've just bought the Hauppauge PVR-150 and I'm having trouble making it to work properly. I can't watch TV trough mplayer without getting an "Your computer is too slow" advice, and getting drops on the stream.

The funny thing is that I can capture TV without any problems using cat /dev/video0 > /tmp/test.mpg, and I can actually watch TV perfectly running:

```

$ cat /dev/video0 > /tmp/test.mpg
$ mplayer /tmp/test.mpg

```

both simultaneously.

I have already tried to build my own from the mplayer SVN, without any results.

Here is the mplayer output after a while:
```

Possible reasons, problems, workarounds:
- Most common: broken/buggy _audio_ driver
  - Try -ao sdl or use the OSS emulation of ALSA.
  - Experiment with different values for -autosync, 30 is a good start.
- Slow video output
  - Try a different -vo driver (-vo help for a list) or try -framedrop!
- Slow CPU
  - Don't try to play a big DVD/DivX on a slow CPU! Try some of the lavdopts,
    e.g. -vfm ffmpeg -lavdopts lowres=1:fast:skiploopfilter=all.
- Broken file
  - Try various combinations of -nobps -ni -forceidx -mc 0.
- Slow media (NFS/SMB mounts, DVD, VCD etc)
  - Try -cache 8192.
- Are you using -cache to play a non-interleaved AVI file?
  - Try -nocache.
Read DOCS/HTML/en/video.html for tuning/speedup tips.
If none of this helps you, read DOCS/HTML/en/bugreports.html.

Thanks in advance.
