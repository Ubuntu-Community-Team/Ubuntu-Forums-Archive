Hello there, this is my first thread. I've Ubuntu 9.04 installed and i've the generic driver that gives me a horrible screen resolution. In earlier versions I installed the proprietary driver downloaded from nvidia's site. I installed the kernel headers and run the driver and everything worked well. But this is not happening in this version. I've the newest driver for my card, installed the kernel headers with:
```
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
```And that install the kernel headers, i have the 2.6.28-15-generic.
When i run the driver, first stopped my GDM, accept the lisence, and following the normal steps, and when it goes to create the kernel modules is stopped by an error. I put the out of the Nvidia installer log:
```

-> License accepted.
-> Installing NVIDIA driver version 96.43.07.
-> No precompiled kernel interface was found to match your kernel; would you li
   ke the installer to attempt to download a kernel interface for your kernel f
   rom the NVIDIA ftp site (ftp://download.nvidia.com)? (Answer: Yes)
-> No matching precompiled kernel interface was found on the NVIDIA ftp site;
   this means that the installer will need to compile a kernel interface for

ERROR: If you are using a Linux 2.4 kernel, please make sure
       you either have configured kernel sources matching your
       kernel or the correct set of kernel headers installed
       on your system.
       
       If you are using a Linux 2.6 kernel, please make sure
       you have configured kernel sources matching your kernel
       installed on your system. If you specified a separate
       output directory using either the "KBUILD_OUTPUT" or
       the "O" KBUILD parameter, make sure to specify this
       directory with the SYSOUT environment variable or with
       the equivalent nvidia-installer command line option.
       
       Depending on where and how the kernel sources (or the
       kernel headers) were installed, you may need to specify
       their location with the SYSSRC environment variable or
       the equivalent nvidia-installer command line option.
ERROR: Installation has failed.  Please see the file
       '/var/log/nvidia-installer.log' for details.  You may find suggestions
       on fixing installation problems in the README available on the Linux
       driver download page at www.nvidia.com.
```What could be happening?

I have noticed that there is not much support for older video cards in ubuntu.

Greetings and thanks for your time
