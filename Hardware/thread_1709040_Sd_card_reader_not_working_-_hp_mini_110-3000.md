**I installed ubuntu 10.04 lucid on this netbook (hp mini 110) and I can't seem to get the sd card reader to recognize sd cards. I'm not very familiar with ubuntu but does anyone have a solution? Much appreciated!**

**When I type lsusb i get:**

You might need to put a SD card in the reader, before it will be recognized on the USB bus.  Also try different USB connectors on your computer -- they are not all the same, necessarily.
