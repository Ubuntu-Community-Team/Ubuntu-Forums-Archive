i have had the hardest time figuring this out. im trying to discover what graphics card my dell studio 17-1737 has, and i keep getting different model types and all kinds of confusing info. heres what dell says the card is:Intel®  965PM / GM Express Chipset

But right below that it says it has a graphics chip called the Intel®  Integrated Graphics Media Accelerator X3100

but ubuntu says when i lspci its an intel mobile 4 series chipset.

plus, i recently looked in the jockey.logfile to see a bunch of errors when trying to retrieve information about drivers (which would explain why i have the mesa driver, since jockey couldnt find anything else).

And online ive heard it has a slew of other names, and i am as confused as could be. what im trying to do is upgrade the driver so i can do more graphical stuff (glxgears only gets me 60fps with the default mesa driver. that sucks!). if anybody could get me pointed in the right direction it would be very appreciated.

Glxgears is locked at 60fps since that's the refresh rate of your display.  It's also not a good way to measure performance.  If you really wanted to, you could install the xorg-edgers ppa, and update the kernel to a more recent release to get newer drivers.  I doubt you'd see any noticeable difference on that older Intel graphics chip, though.

*edit* by the way it doesn't really matter which of those it is.  The driver supports a wide range of chips and will figure it out on it's own with most of the intel GPUs.  Just not the latest sandy bridge stuff.

okay, thanks for the info. my specific problem is that theres a game i tried to run under wine that gave me an error on start up saying that no 3d hardware was detected, and then crashes. i checked on wine hq and it says it should run nearly perfect. is there any way i can get 3d hardware accel? 

also, i found a package in synaptic that seems to fit the bill, but im not sure if its what i need to get 3d. its called "i965-va-driver", but it describes itself as allowing video acceleration, not hardware.

To see how your system components identify themselves to the system when probed, open a terminal and try these commands:
```
lshw   # Be patient, it takes a minute
lspci -vv
lsusb
```

For example, my cheap-but-effective video card shows up as:
```
01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RS690M [Radeon X1200 Series] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])

thanks, those were very useful. especially the second command. take a look at the kernel driver, though: ```
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Memory Controller Hub (rev 07)
    Subsystem: Dell Device 02a0
    Control: I/O- Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR+ FastB2B- DisINTx-
    Status: Cap+ 66MHz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=fast >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort+ >SERR- <PERR- INTx-
    Latency: 0
    Capabilities: <access denied>
    Kernel driver in use: agpgart-intel
    Kernel modules: intel-agp
```
in all the time ive been looking around, i have not heard of the agpgart-intel driver. i guess that is the default driver (?). ill have to do some more looking around.

AGPgart isnt really the driver. See here- 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGPgart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGPgart)

As for the naming, that is what happens sometimes. I've seen older intel chipsets identify the video as 'i810 video' or 'intel 740' depending on which OS (etc) you asked.

as far as i could tell from that link, im using a mesa driver, which i think ive seen in the terminal with "lspci". so what does that mean for my card? driver upgrade or no?

and yeah, the naming thing is silly. my chip goes by at least 3 different names.

You can always try to get newer drivers, with xorg-edgers-PPA (be warned, this could lead to video driver breakage, there is always a chance fo that happening when you go to much newer rivers). 

I dont think its going to make a huge difference to your video performance, but I'd be happy to be wrong. ;)

i found a package in synaptic that just might be what im looking for. its called libva-x11-1, and its supposed to give video/hardware acceleration to intel gma chips. should i give it a go?

[wikipedia]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Acceleration_API") says that this library is not supported on your card.

To be honest, you've got a pretty cheap old card - probably 60fps is as fast as it can go n.b. glxgears is not a very good measure of frame-rate.

Also - according to [this]("https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/IntelPerformance"), 60fps is common when vblank synching is turned on (search "Problem: glxgears has low FPS" in the article)

Assuming that you've got a desktop pc - buy a decent nvidia card instead.

Ah, well that sucks. Went through all this trouble to find out my card is a piece of crap. That seems a bit odd to me, as I could run games with similar requirements, albeit with some reduced graphics, rather decently when I had vista. I guess intel doesn't like Linux that much. Or processors are getting better so fast that theyre obsolete as soon as they're off the assembly line. 

It's not a big deal that I can't run the game, I bought it for $5. And besides, I'll probably have a computer that can run it in a few months. Thanks for all the help, though. :D

No, it's just vsync locking the framerate to the monitor refresh (to stop tearing). Even software rendering done through the CPU is significantly faster on any half-decent CPU. Intel's chips aren't the fastest, but they're not that bad for basic 3D and video playback.

To OP: I would suggest looking at the output of glxinfo to make sure 3D is enabled:
```
sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo
```

### Post by u-noob-tu on 2011-01-25
judging from this output, id say 3d is not enabled. towards the bottom youll see a lot stuff with "dri" in it. i looked it up in synaptic and theres a tool there called driconfig that might be useful.
