Hi,

I'm having trouble with my wireless. I'm dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 9.10 on a Sony Vaio FW series.

I had gotten the wireless to work before, and it started to not work a couple of weeks ago. The little green button next to my wireless button shows up, so I think it is recognizing it, but it won't detect any wireless connections.

Can anybody help me with this? I'm new to Ubuntu, so I don't really know what to do.

Thanks.
