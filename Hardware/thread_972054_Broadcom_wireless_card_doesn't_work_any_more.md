Hello,

I restarted my machine, and now suddenly my wireless drivers no longer work. The wifi light is on, and i can turn it on and off with the keyboard and in the network manager, no networks are detected.  It was working before, and now its not.  I did upgrade to intrepid ibex, but it was working since its release, and now suddenly its not.  I dont know why.  The last thing i installed was the ubuntu-studio packages so i could use rosegarden with the optimized kernel and optional plug-ins.
