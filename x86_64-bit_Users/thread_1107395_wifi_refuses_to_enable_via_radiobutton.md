I believe there is a known old bug with the iwl3945 driver: If you kill the wifi using the hotkey on the laptop then you will not be able to restart using the same hotkey.

a) use network manager applet to enable/disable wifi, or

b) after trying to re-enable wifi using hotkey, remove module and reload module with:

sudo rmmod iwl3945
sudo modprobe iwl3945

Check 'dmesg', since the hotkey still enables/disables wifi at a hardware level, and radio needs to be enabled before reloading modules. Basically you can re-enable using module method after pressing the button an even number of times :)
