title: "[SOLVED] Wireless issue"

forum: New to Ubuntu

### Post by loyaleagle on 2009-01-10
I had to install a new copy of Ubuntu on this laptop. Everything is great except for the fact that the wireless connection does not work or is not being recognized. Network manager only shows the wired connection.

I have a Atheros Communications Inc. AR242x 802.11abg Wireless PCI Express Adapter. The new generic Ubuntu Atheros driver does not seem to work for my card. 

I have tried to search this forum, but there were so many suggestions that I was afraid to try. 

Is there a simple solution?

Thanks...

For anyone else out there having the same problem.....

I did some more research and found this solution.

I don't know if this was the right thing to do, but it seemed to work for me.
