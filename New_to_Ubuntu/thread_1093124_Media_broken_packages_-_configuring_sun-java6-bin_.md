title: "Media broken packages - configuring sun-java6-bin re"
date: 2009-03-11
forum: New to Ubuntu

While trying to install the necessary media codecs, the following message came up:

E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.

Ok. I then ran the command which brings me back to the Sun java configuration part "Configuring sun-java6-bin re."
here the minimised screen freezes and I am forced to abort the installation as there is no way to proceed further.

While trying out mp3 playback in Rhythmbox I get the following message:

This is a major failure of your software management system. Please check for broken packages with synaptic, check the file permissions and correctness of the file '/etc/apt/sources.list' and reload the software information with: 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install -f'.

Okay, so go ahead and post the output of these commands:

```
ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```

If your screen freezes again, you can do Ctrl-Alt-F1 to open a text-only terminal and log in that way.

This is the output from the 2 suggested commands. Forgot to mention I am running Ubuntu 8.10, if that could be of some relevance.
When I said the screen froze, I meant the sun-java screen which appears in the terminal window.

Is it 'freezing' at the EULA screen? If so *tab > enter *

### Post by binbash on 2009-03-11
It is probably EULA screen.tab enter will fix that
