title: "[SOLVED] 7.04 - Accidently Hit &amp;quot;Upgrade To 8.04&amp;quot; - Now Can't Update"

[FONT="Tahoma"]New laptop and getting used to the touchpad speeds.  When I went to check for updates, I accidently clicked on the upgrade and it started to go through until I cancled it.  Now, when I try and update I get a message
"Could not complete all updates" and asked to use a partial update, which takes me back to the upgrade to 8.04.  I do not want to do this yet, I want to stay on 7.10 for now.

Also, when I go to the Synaptic Package Manager and go to Mark All Upgrades, I find these to be removed
- apparmor
- apparmmor-utils
- startup-tasks
- system-services
- ubuntu minimal
- upstart
- upstart-combat-sysv
- upstart-logd
To BE Installed
- sysvinit


Is there any way to undo what I did, or clear it out so I can just check for the regular updates?
Also, I think I have hosed my sources list and could use an original if I can copy someone else's.[/FONT]

Only way to get 7.10 is to reinstall it.  Otherwise you should finish the 8.04 upgrade.

If you check your sources 

sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

You'll probably find they are all hardy.

If you replace hardy with gutsy you might have a chance.

If I were you I'd do the upgrade.

In any case backup your home folder/important stuff.

Actually, I'm running version 7.10 right now.  

Can I just restore my original sources list?  Or, delete all the contents and find the original?

I don't want to go to 8.x right now, but plan to in the near future

Post the output of 

cat /etc/apt/sources.list

Like sef said. You'd be better off letting the upgrade finish now.

[FONT="Verdana"]I'm just learing of updating, because I've heard 4+ people tell me the upgrade broke, and ended up doing a clean install again anyway. 

Anyway I can "clean" these update files out, and just get the normal updates?[/FONT]
