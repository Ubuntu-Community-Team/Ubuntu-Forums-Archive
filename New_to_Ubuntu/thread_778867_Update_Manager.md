i am using 8.04.  is there something wrong with the update manager?  it tells me that it can only partial upgrade, and it wont let me use the add remove program. does anybody else have this problem.

Maybe you should do the partial upgrade and see if it fixes the problem

You are using the latest version, so I don't get how you would be able the upgrade.

That partial update could be some programs that need upgrading, most likely because you upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Please post the output of:-
```
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Please do not do a partial upgrade unless you are very sure that it is safe and is meant to be done(which is unlikely if you have Ubuntu 8.04 final).
