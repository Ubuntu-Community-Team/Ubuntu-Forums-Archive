title: "Install  Ubuntu 10.10 completely"

### Post by TedinOz on 2011-01-06
I have been using Ubuntu for a week now and am completely sold!  I am running dual boot with Windows Vista and have removed all my info from Vista into an external hard drive storage ready to install into Ubuntu and am now ready to completely install Ubuntu and remove Windows from my hard drive. My question is, how exactly do I do that?  I'm guessing that if I re-run the install CD I will be able to reinstall it on it's own but at the same time will that wipe out all that I have done on my initial dual boot install and have to start over? Is this correct or is there an alternative way to do this and save the input I have made so far?...bearing in mind that I am pretty inexperienced in the ways of IT and would prefer a simplified 'follow the prompts' method.

However I do this, my main objective is to allocate my whole hard drive to Ubuntu (never want to go back to Windows), and this is where I need to be careful I think, as I am not yet proficient in creating or altering partitions. I remember when I first did the dual install that I allocated 17Gb (I think) to Ubuntu but now I am ready to make the change I want to maximise the storage in my new Ubuntu. 

If a complete new install is the best way (or only) way to go I can live with that but I just want to be careful that I don't muck up so if anyone can guide me on this please, that would be great.

I'm pretty new, but i may be able to help (I just had to do something similarly). Just go into Gparted partition editor, and delete all the partitions involving windows. then format all the new unallocated space (im not sure what the best thing to format it to is). formating will erase it all. then you should be able to right click in the Linux partition and then click resize. add all the available space to the partition (or if you want to leave some as unallocated you can). if you don't have Gparted, just run sudo apt-get Gparted in the terminal. Again, im new, so you may want to get someone with more experience to confirm. but im pretty sure that's what i did.

Slow down! wowww! Hold your horses...Ubuntu being the lovely thing it is is fine but you have a dual boot!!!If anything goes wrong you can refer to the other...Best of both worlds...
Take it easy and take several days over to think about it.
Don't get over excited...leads to trouble.
Relax sit back and think it out...

First lets make sure we understand **your** definition of dual boot. Is the Ubuntu installed a Wubi to start with=you installed from a live windows environment. Or did you boot the cd and partitioned space for it, and your using the grub menu to dual boot. Not the windows bootloader to get to the grub menu to get to Ubuntu.

Do this it will answer a lot of questions in the what is where of your set up. So from a booted live Ubuntu cd or thumbdrive lets see the bootscript read out; in my signature just click on it and follow the instructions. Come back to the thread and click on the # in the reply panel this makes code tags paste all the text in between.

A snippet/screen shot of the disk manager or screen shot of gparted in Ubuntu would be a good start, at the least.

Thanks for this. I guess this is where my novice status really shows and I am a bit nervous about proceeding with your guide without being absolutely sure. So I hope you don't mind if I put a screen capture here of what I get when opening Gparted because I am unsure how to proceed in relation to you comments above.


[Gparted.png]("http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=180305&stc=1&d=1294341941")

From this how do I identify which partitions involve windows? I can see how to delete but here that option only applies to /dev/sda1 and 3. /dev/sda2 is locked and can't be deleted. From there however I admit I am lost with regard reformatting and resizing. Maybe a new install with the CD is a better option for me with my limited knowledge, but will that work?

So please be careful other posters here in just giving a idea when we are talking about somebodies operating system. Do not make a assumption of a fix, gather the facts, then proceed.

OP you have a wubi install to begin with, you should be dual booting to begin with, in a partitioned setup, not a wubi, in order to have a full understanding of Ubuntu. You want to make sure what ever you have saved, will work in Linux. The operating systems are totally different, are you with me here. I would say ignore the previous posts as they are based on no information, but we now know you have a wubi setup, this **should** of been at the top of the information you gave to begin with.

 I installed from the CD not Wubi so I am able to sign into Ubuntu or Windows from start up so I guess I partitioned space for it. A screen shot of gparted was attached to the reply to Red Raven above but I am lost as to what you are asking  here about bootscript I'm sorry.. " So from a booted live Ubuntu cd or thumbdrive lets see the bootscript read out; in my signature just click on it and follow the instructions" Where do I find 'my signature to follow this process? I am ok with with posting between code tags here
Thanks for your involvement.

Here is the conundrum, because you are a new user you don't understand. I helped red-raven get setup with a partitioned dual boot last week they are a new user doing quite well, but to quick on the advice in this area.

If you look at the gparted post it shows only ntfs partitions that is a wubi install, here is a picture of a real dual boot on my gparted. Basically I'm trying to protect you from yourself here in that you understand. You will notice that the Ubuntu is in ext4 partitions.

If you download and run the script found here - [http://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/)
it will generate a results.txt document which will detail the boot setup you have and clear up any confusion about Wubi (ubuntu installed inside windows) or a real dual boot. :-)

Then you can get relevant advice as to how to proceed ;-)

Edit -> I too was over eager with some advice a while back :? - Wilee-Nilee is right to suggest working out the lay of the land before proceeding :-)

No I don't have a Wubi set up as I said above and I am cautious about proceeding until I feel I know what I am doing. Thanks for you advice re transferring files from Windows...I have tested these from the external harddrive and they all function well in Ubuntu. I am comitted to leaving Windows...my system there needs a lot of repair which I am not capable of doing, and I really do like Ubuntu.

Look at my gparted yes you have a wubi installation. You are being helped by a user who knows this, unless you have a HD that is not showing in you screenshot.
In the top right corner of gparted is a dropdown to show all the HD's. gparted doesn't show all of them in one screen like the disk manager in windows.

As suggested by myself and hippytaff you need to run the bootscript here if you want accurate help or confirm the one HD.

Yes I can see the difference so I guess I did do a wubi install but certainly not knowing that I did. I apologise for my ignorance. Allowing for that I am still not sure where to go from here.

Hey no problem.:) as you might be realising now, it is important to not just take anybodies advice. They're a lot of users on this forum who are willing to give advice without the proper background and information, be careful in this advice.

You can actually move that wubi to a partition if you want to, but I suggest that maybe setting up a real partitioned dual boot at first is the more tried and true method, in that you will have both while you get the hang of Ubuntu and Linux. We can remove Vista at some point but I would give yourself some time to adjust with a real dual boot first.

Thank you. I can see that you know what you are doing no question. I will do the bootscript and post it back.

So does hippytaff, and post #3 was good advice as well. There are a lot of people on the forum that know this it is just making sure your talking with them.:)

Is this your own website? If so there are better explanations that are provided. If your pushing your own website, make sure you get a understanding of the users level of understanding first please, otherwise you are cluttering when people who will go to the lengths of confirmation will make sure that the user understands.

I have downloaded boot_info_script055.sh as here....

[boot info download.jpg]("http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=180321&stc=1&d=1294352264")

Obviously I have to save it somehow for the Terminal command to work but when I try to Save As...(the only option) I get this message..

.[Error message.png]("http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=180322&stc=1&d=1294352438")

When I click Replace within this error message I get this message at the top of the boot_info_script window.

[2nd Error message.png]("http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=180323&stc=1&d=1294352611")

I don't seem to have a plain text writer in the system so again my ignorance is showing and I even need help with this small task :( I have found Pandoc...general markup converter in the system downloads..do I need to install that to save the file?

I have to leave here for a few hours but if you guys can offer some more guidance so I can get the bootscript done for you I will appreciate it greatly and get back to you when I am online again.

Thanks

So you need to boot a live Ubuntu cd to run this script. You download the script from the link, go to downloads then drag it to the desktop in Ubuntu. Then run this command just copy and paste it to the Ubuntu terminal. The bootscript link in my signature has this same command, I know it is confusing it was for me the first time so, feel free to ask questions.
```
sudo bash ~/Desktop/boot_info_script*.sh
```

You mentioned already that you have backed up the needed stuff you want from Vista, what exactly is that?

As it is shrinking Vista with it being rather full, can be done, but it is really at its limit for prudent/efficient use now. But whenever you do this with a MS partition you have to be prepared, in that it should be defragged, and a chkdsk /r run probably, beforehand, and if you have stuff saved externally that is not system stuff for Vista but media, then removing it from Vista first would be prudent. This removal would be done before the defragging and running a chkdsk /r

If you really think you have Vista backed up and can confirm that it all runs on a Live Ubuntu cd, and you don't need any Vista=MS native software, you could just wipe it and install Ubuntu, but I think a dual boot to begin with is a better idea. I'm not sure you are aware of the difference in the operating systems. You may be sorry that you removed Vista after it is gone I'm not sure.:)

I posted the results from the test script.

I really no longer have any allegiance to Vista. It has been running badly but I have been in there since installing Ubuntu and it does work albeit not good. I think if I did the dual boot as you are suggesting I would still have to try to remedy whatever was going wrong there and really now that I have found Ubuntu as a clean and precise system (which is all I need for the domestic stuff I do) why keep Vista?

The experience of doing the dual boot would be good for my learning processes I know but I don't want to take up all of your time just for that.

I'll see what you recommend after this but if if looks beyond my capabilities then I'm very happy to continue with Ubuntu only.

Thanks again for your time on this

I forgot to answer your question re info from Vista. These are a combination of Document, Photo and Media Files which I now have on the external drive and I have already used them on Ubuntu with great success. Ubuntu seems to be geared to accept them in Microsoft format and convert them to the Linux system so from that point of view I am happy they will work.

Fair enough, all you have to do then, if you don't mind just doing a fresh install is boot the Ubuntu cd hit install and choose the install to the whole HD.

I would suggest the moving the Ubuntu to a partition, but to be honest, with you having problems just running the script correctly I suspect it would not work for you it is a bit more complicated. What you posted for the script is the actual script that needs to be run rather then what the script generates as a text file for posting.

I'm sure I could do it with guidance but if I muck it up I might ruin it completely. Very happy with Ubuntu...I know I have an extremely lot to learn here but that challenge is part of what appeals to me. Maybe if I fully install it I can study how to create partitions etc after. But if you want to provide me with the procedure I'll look at it and then decide if it is too tough for me. If not I'll just fully install.

Thanks again!  You guys are great!

I would just boot the Live cd to the live desktop=try Ubuntu click on the install, when you get to the HD partitioning part just choose install to the whole HD, I forget exactly what it says. This will just let Ubuntu build it all for you like magic, you will put in a user name and password and your off to the races.

Hey if you got wubi installed this full install to the HD will be familiar, I think you will be fine. You have everything saved on the external so you wont brick the computer just following a basic install to the whole HD.

I think your smart to learn about partitioning at your own leisure you can do it with a thumbdrive to begin with later. Ubuntu is a fairly easy install, some new users want to try to much and learn to much rather then giving themselves time to do this. This can be a strain on the helping, if your trying to get a install done while tutoring the new user. Really I suspect most don't remember all this help, you have to do it a few times to get the hang of partitioning. 

Ask any questions if needed, and thanks for your patience with me as well.:)

Well thanks so much again. It's you who been the patient one. I'll certainly remember the help. I'll proceed as you have suggested and look forward to happy learning on Ubuntu.

I am sorry to say that I have problem with the install now. I booted from the Ubuntu startup disc proceeded with a full install, got to the "Who are you Page" with personal info and password etc. The install was proceeding showing 'Copying files' in the progress bar and when the progress bar got to about 3/4 complete, the display message changed to 'Ready when you are...' and stalled completely. The "Ready when you are...' message offers a dropdown arrow which when clicked opens what appears to be a Terminal Command line. The last entry there reads...

Jan 8 (time) ubuntu ubiquity [3272]: debconffilter_done: ubiquity.component nstall (current: ubi-usersetup)

I am lost now :(.  I don't know whether to shut down on the power switch or maybe there is a command that needs to be entered here which I don't know. If I shut down with the CD in will the old system have been retained?  I'm hoping someone can help me please! Maybe the startup disc is faulty although it worked fine when I did the Wubi install. I can't show any of the info here as I am doing this from another computer.

Ok to add to the last post the cd just moved and a new message came up in the terminal window :

(date time etc) ubuntu CRON[7628]: (root) CMD (  cd / && run-parts --report/etc/cron.hourly

Well, at this point, if the installer has froze, you have no choice but to attempt a restart... I'm not aware of any terminal command that will "restart" the installer where it left off.

First of all, you should make sure you installed from a live cd, not from inside windows (that's wubi). Then, think this over. Are you SURE you want to do this? a have done some things before without thinking, and I have paid for them with the entire system messing up, or losing some critical data, etc. Then, you should install gparted, delete all of the NTFS partitions (they should be windows), then add then to the other partition (the 3+/- Gb partition is the swap file). You should be good to go!

Thanks. The installation stall was happening because I wasn't internet connected. A new lesson for this novice. I am now fully installed and very happy. Thanks for all your cautions but yes I am sure I want no more part of Vista. Ubuntu is very efficient, and a joy to work in and I am here to stay.

Thanks to everyone for their great support here. This forum is the icing on the cake of a great system :)

Sure, i'm happy you're good to go. If you need anymore help, remember, Ubuntu forums is here ti help! I had a problem on a 6+ year old computer with it's broadcomm wireless driver (i'm writing this on it right now!). I had looked at different threads to no avail. I posted my own thread (actually 2), and within a day, it was working perfectly!
