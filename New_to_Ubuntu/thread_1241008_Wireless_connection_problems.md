I just bought a new laptop (hp dv6-1210sa) and am having problems connecting to wireless internet in ubunutu (but not in vista).  It seems not to even recognise the wireless networks, let alone connect.

I had a look at the troubleshooting section of the ubuntu help but was unable to sort it out myself.  I have the terminal output for the commands mentioned there though:

I should probably point out that I'm living in a shared house, hence using a shared connection which I'm not in charge of and not really in a position to do too much with.  I also won't have any wired capabilities in ubuntu either until I go back to university in 7 weeks (assuming I don't run into problems with wired internet as well).

I imagine this probably limits what I can do just now, but I would appreciate any advice if there's something I could do to get it working just now; or pointers to how to proceed when I do get access to wired internet.

Thanks for any help :)
