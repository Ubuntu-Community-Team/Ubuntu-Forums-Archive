I have a Dell Studio 1555. I had Karmic running on it without any issues with Pulseaudio. Yesterday, I made some stupid mistake and had to reinstall Ubuntu. Now Audio doesn't work. It doesn't detect my Audio card.

Fail on my part. Just had to delete .pulse folder from home directory. That fixed it.
