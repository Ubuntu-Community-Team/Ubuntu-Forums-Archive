### Post by THXTom on 2010-01-04
Hi all, been using this box w/Ubuntu 9.10 for awhile now and printing with it fine.

Today it's having connection problems. Sometimes it prints or just que's up jobs.

go to HP toolbox and sometimes it shows ink levels, or not.

Dont see CUPS running in process (it has been thou), toolbox says Device comm error 5012.

This is a networked printer (HP309A) thru a Linksys WRT54GS.

Here's a log of hp-check -t:
