I just got Ubuntu installed on this computer and the wireless wont work on it. Wireless is a necessity to me. I need the dummies directions to how to get it to work. The dumbest you think I am take a level dumber to help me understand what EXACTLY I have to do. I've been getting directions like "plug in this string" but they don't tell me where to put it or anything. I'm very new to Ubuntu in that I never actually did the fixing when something went wrong with my other computer.

Thanks

To help you, I need a little more information. 
First, Do you have another way of connecting ubuntu to the internet, like an ethernet cable?
Second I think you have the same card as me, but to be sure, do the following: Open a terminal by going to Applications > Accessories and clicking on Terminal. At the prompt type
```
lspci
```
and post the results back here.

While "lspci" will do, I'd rather see you post the output of ```
sudo lshw -C network
``` as that will only return relevant information and more detail.

No offense, Tim. Thanks.

 None taken. My card is listed as a Dell 1395 WLAN mini card on the build sheet, but I'm not 100% confident in Dell's ability not to make a mistake:) .

I have the same problem as jost1989, as I cannot get detected my wireless card, even when I go to Hardware Drivers.
