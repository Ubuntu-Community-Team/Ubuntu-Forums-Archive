basically I have a working wireless connection using my flashed router. it will show uo in windows and give me the quality of the connection. but under ubuntu it will connect but not show a connection. is there a fix to that?

There is an issue with some cards (Ralink if I recall correctly) where network manager connects but the icon shows that it's not connected.  

can you post the output of ```
lspci
``` 
run in a terminal (Applications --> Accessories -> Terminal).  To copy from the terminal highlight the text and press ctrl+shift+c.  That will tell us what wireless card you have.
