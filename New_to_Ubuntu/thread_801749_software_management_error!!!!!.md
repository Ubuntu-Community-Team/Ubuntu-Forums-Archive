every time i open sofrtware managment thing in ubuntu 7.1 it gives an error that reads:   
This is a major failure of your software management system. Please check for broken packages with synaptic, check the file permissions and correctness of the file '/etc/apt/sources.list' and reload the software information with: 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install -f'.

I looked around and found my sources.list file and it is as follows:

Ok what were you installing when you received the errors? You can go to synaptic manager located under system, administration. There under edit you can fix broken packages. Also you can use the terminal to run the commands give, the terminal is located under applications, accessories.
Use these commands
```
sudo ap-get install -f
sudo apt-get update
``` Your password will not show when type but just type and enter.
