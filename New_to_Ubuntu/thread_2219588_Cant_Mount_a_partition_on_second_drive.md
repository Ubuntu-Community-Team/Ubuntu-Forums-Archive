title: "Cant Mount a partition on second drive"

### Post by richard50 on 2014-04-24
I am dual booting with Windows 7. It has mounted to one partition on the second hard drive, but wont mount to another partition. This particular partition is my main storage for all of my files like pics and stuff. I do have a second page file on this partition for windows 7. Could that be the issue?
Error message:
Error mounting /dev/sdb4 at /media/richard/Disk 2: Command-line `mount -t "ntfs" -o "uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177" "/dev/sdb4" "/media/richard/Disk 2"' exited with non-zero exit status 12: Failed to read last sector (843565055): Invalid argument
HINTS: Either the volume is a RAID/LDM but it wasn't setup yet,
   or it was not setup correctly (e.g. by not using mdadm --build ...),
   or a wrong device is tried to be mounted,
   or the partition table is corrupt (partition is smaller than NTFS),
   or the NTFS boot sector is corrupt (NTFS size is not valid).
Failed to mount '/dev/sdb4': Invalid argument
The device '/dev/sdb4' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS.
Maybe the wrong device is used? Or the whole disk instead of a
partition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around?

Your sdb drive shows SFS which is dynamic partitions in Windows.  That does not work with Linux and does not even work with some Windows repair tools. That is what Windows does if you want more than 4 primary partitions.

 Microsofts offical policy is a full backup, erase dynamic partitions and create new basic partitions. There is no undo.
Dynamic volume is a Microsoft proprietary format developed together with Veritas (now acquired by Symantec) for logical volumes.
You may be use a third-party tool, such as Partition Wizard MiniTool or EASEUS to convert a convert a dynamic disk to a basic disk without having to delete or format them.
I've never used any of these and so I can't be sure they will work.Be sure to have good backups as any major partition change has risks.
Dynamic also on gpt as LDM

EASEUS Partition Master - The free home edition converted both dynamic partitions into basic partitions in less than 5 minutes!!
