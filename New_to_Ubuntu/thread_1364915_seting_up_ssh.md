Im thinking of setting up an ssh server with an old pentium 4 I am doing nothing with. Can anyone point me to a good guide on accomplishing this?

It goes like this for me:

I guess what you want is file sharing between two linux boxes - there is NO WINDOWS involved.

1.) Make sure the openssh-server and openssh-client are installed on both machines.

```
sudo apt-get install ssh
```Is a meta package and will install both applications. Or you can search for it in Synpatic and install it from there.

2.) Go to the machine you want to connect to. You need to find the machines IP address, so in Terminal:

```
ifconfig
```

This should give you an output just like this one

Your output can differ quite a bit, but the important information is just the bold bit. These four numbers are the address of the machine (do not use the 127.0.0.1 address - this the internal address of your network adapter).

So, in my case the address would be 192.168.1.68

3.) Access the computer
Now, when you want to access a computer from the other, go to places>connect to server.
- Choose SSH as the "service type" from the drop down list
- the server is the IP of the other computer (the one you want to access)
- the port can be left blank (this means it assumes port 22)
- the folder you should put in is /home - but you can leave it blank in which case you will access the other machine at "/" level and then navigate to /home/username
- the username *must* be specified. This is the user you use to log into the other computer.
- also, enable the bookmark and choose a name for it. This means this connection will always reappear in your places menu and in the sidebar(left) in your filebrowser

Click OK

You may get a message about keys on first time connection. Just OK it

You will then be asked for the password of the user of the other machine. Put it in, and if you do not want to be bothered by this anymore - choose always remember.

Now a folder should open with the folder on the other machine.

From this folder you will be able to browse the other machine and transfer files back and forth.

Bandwidth and external security should not be an issue because you are deploying your local network and not going out over the internet. Also, ssh is Secure Shell which is designed to be just that i.e. secure.

Hope this helps.

If you're wanting to access this computer over the Internet you'll have to find out what the IP address being assigned to your router is (if you have one).  You can visit [www.whatismyip.com](www.whatismyip.com) to get this.

Now you wouldn't want to have to do this every day before you leave the house so look into seeing if your router has the ability to run a Dynamic DNS service.  If so, you'll be able to setup a free account at [www.dyndns.org](www.dyndns.org), select a hostname, and then use that hostname instead of an IP address to connect over the web.  Saves you the trouble of having to worry about your ISP-assigned IP address and memorize it.  Just be sure you set SSH up to run with a strong password.
