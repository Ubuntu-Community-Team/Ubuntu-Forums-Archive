Re: StarCraft Fresh Install
Aion is known not to run as of yet via Wine and I have never personally tried city of heros but be sure to check the appdb for that one.

As for Starcraft and Diablo 2 I have gotten these to run on multiple different Ubuntu systems with Wine with little to-no tweaking. Perhaps open your winecfg and set Starcraft and/or Diablo to run in a "virtual desktop" and see if they load then

Re: StarCraft Fresh Install
Can you try running the game from terminal and post the output it gives when the game crashes out? (To run it from terminal change directory to the location of your game.exe and then run
Code:

wine game.exe

)

Re: StarCraft Fresh Install
change embedded resolution to 640x400 for starcraft. or 320x240 if that doesn't work. if 640x400 works you can try 800x600.

The resolution hacks do not work in wine either...

Hello,

I have had issues running AOE2 in Wine that sound about the same. What I found was an issue with the Desktop integration to the Wine "Desktop". So I configured Wine to run an emulated desktop.

Click Apps -> Wine -> Configure Wine

Then select the Graphics tab and check the box "Emulate a virtual Desktop" and set the Desktop size in the boxes below. Might want to check with the game vendor to see what size they run it at.

No idea if this will help, hopefully though :)

tried changing resolution but still same

### Post by Capt. Blackwood on 2009-09-30
Try using default wine configuration, and running the game. 

Are you using any "NO CD" patches or anything like that?

---

### Post by vlad1975 on 2009-10-01
im not using any patch its just straight up install and play. As far as i know its default wine. i have not done anything since i installed wine as i dont really know anything about it

---

### Post by Capt. Blackwood on 2009-10-01
this question may sound stupid,


did you copy your install over...or was this fresh from the cds?

My install is fresh and my copy of wine just got updated...i'll give it a go tonight and will see happens.

Well, you're making progress. The glxinfo looks right to me after the reinstall (before was a problem). Still seems like the drivers are messed up and you have no openGL support in them from the wine error dump. Can you run
```

glxgears

```
Can you run a native linux game with high end 3d graphics like maybe tremulous or nexuiz (they're in the repos)? It could also be a problem with your wine using openGL, did you install your version of wine from the repos or from source? If you installed from the repos did you install from the default ubuntu repos or the appdb repos? My recommendation would be to use the appdb repos for wine (it's what I use) and I have no problems with starcraft with it.

Soo.. you think i should uninstall and reinstall wine? if so how do i uninstall wine? and how about the other appp that is running in wine? will i have to reinstall them too?

Ok, if you can see the spinning gears it means you have at *some* 3D graphics working, so problem is most likely with wine, especially since you installed from source which can be tricky. I would recommend [uninstalling wine from source](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=458333), and then install from the appdb repos. Instructions for setting up these repos can be found [here](http://www.winehq.org/download/deb).
