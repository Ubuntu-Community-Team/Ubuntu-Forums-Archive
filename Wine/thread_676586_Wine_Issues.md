Been trying to get wine to work, I've tried some things on these forums, and I'm still stuck.  Here's what I can give to help speed this up.

Any idea?  I'm new to linux.

Is there some reason you're trying to install the version of Wine that's in the repositories, instead of installing the latest version of Wine from the website?  That might work better for you.

You'll have to enable the universe repository (and maybe the multiverse).

In case you're using regular ubuntu: Go to System-->Administration-->Synaptic. From within Synaptic, choose Settings-->Repositories and tick the universe and multiverse options. And untick the cdrom option (because it will only slow things down). Accept, click reload and try to install wine again. 

Good luck.

Got it to work from what happy said, thanks.

Keep in mind though that if you're using the version of Wine that's in the repositories, you'll be using an old version.
