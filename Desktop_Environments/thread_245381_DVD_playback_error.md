When I try to play a DVD in Totem I get this errror:

```

The program 'totem' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 97 error_code 11 request_code 141 minor_code 19)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

```

I used Automatix to install all the codecs and Non-Free DVD support. I did the exact same install on my laptop and can play DVDs on it no problem but have this problem on my desktop.

Anyone help me?

  It can be a bug in the MPlayer code _or_ in your drivers _or_ in your

  DOCS/HTML/en/bugreports.html and follow the instructions there. We can't and
  won't help unless you provide this information when reporting a possible bug.

Please will someone take a look at this?
