Hi,

I have recently migrated to ubuntu dapper and want to install beryl on it. I have the Intel Corporation 82915G/GV/910GL Express Chipset and 512 Mb of Ram. I followed the wiki on beryl +aiglx install on dapper [Beryl Dapper Wiki]("http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu_Dapper_with_AIGLX")
  but the moment I start beryl or beryl-manager, i just get a white screen.

This is my xorg.conf

I'm not a linux or beryl or even a graphics guru... however i did achieve a breakthrough with all three today...

I was having something that sounds *like* that, and i found the fix after searching for a few months, on and off... and that is to try reducing your graphics from 24 bits to 16 bits.

```
Section "Screen"
        Identifier      "Default Screen"
        Device          "Intel Corporation 82915G/GV/910GL Express Chipset Family Graphics Controller"
        Monitor         "SyncMaster"
        DefaultDepth    **16**
```

as soon as i did that, it worked like a charm.

but then again, see line 1. :-k
