hi folks,

i've recently switched to kubuntu (thanks for all the help!) and was wondering: why do firefox, evolution, azureus, basically most applications i was running pre-KDE, do not take on the theme i assign the desktop to?

i'm big on aesthetics, and i'd love some help on getting this resolved.

thanks!

It's because they're GTK apps; or, at least, the copies you have there are using GTK. To make them use your KDE theme/style you can download the gtk2-engines-gtk-qt package. GTK apps will need to be restarted for changes to take affect, and you can modify the gtk styles now from kcontrol. It shouldn't generally be the case, but you *may* have to restart KDE.

yes!

apt-get install gtk2-engines-gtk-qt

But you will have to enable the universe repository!

vi /etc/apt/sources.list

Find this section

You should consider removing "multiverse" though - Its nonfree!!! (Its a simple copy&paste from the inet - Not my responsibility :))

CTRL+ALT+Backspace.
Although you may like to logout first.
