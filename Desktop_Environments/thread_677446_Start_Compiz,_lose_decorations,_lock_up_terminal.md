Fresh Gutsy,

  With either XGL or AIGLX I keep getting a frozen terminal upon starting Compiz.  When I [Ctrl] C out my window decorations disapear but some of the Compiz features kick in (Window fade).  Restart or Logout-in gets it back to normal as does typing Metacity in the terminal.  

  I think the pixmap thing fixed itself once XGL was recognized on my other machine but it's running ATI and had different issues.

  I'm running an i810 which is supposed to be fully supported.  What stupid little thing have I not done? 

```
$ compiz
