Well, Im using the fiesty fawn beta, and I just set up my dual monitors with an nvidia card. Everythings fantastic, and this is the most satisfied ive ever been with ubuntu, but theres one little problem. When I open a new window, or adjust the volume with my keyboard, the window goes to the exact center of my two monitors, which is where the two monitors meet. Its kinda hard to explain, so heres an artist's rendering:

If it helps, heres my xorg file. I havent touched it, I just let the nvidia manager handle it.
