Hi

I can't figure out how to enable S-Video support on my Toshiba laptop. I have browsed this forum and tryed google, but I didn't understand anything.
The thing about reebouting is tested without any result.

How do I enable the S-Video support?

This is the output from my XF86Config-4 file:

```

Toshiba's laptop manual advises that Adobe fonts will prevent the S-video output from functioning correctly.  Remove all Adobe software.  I did and it worked after that.  I 'unfixed' it to make sure I had found the cause by re-installing Adobe reader, and the problem re-emerged as before.  When I removed Adobe reader, the output to the TV worked fine again.

My son showed me that you can make the switch from laptop to TV by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting a graphic output to the TV.  If you have something like Netflix already running on the laptop screen, it will not give you the ability to switch.    1) Minimize the video software to the tray and then 2) right click the desktop (or use the function key) and the software to route the video signal to the TV will work again, offering you the choice to send the signal to a TV via the S-video port.  When you get the image to the TV successfully,  maximize the image from the tray and en joy the movie.

I don't have this problem on my two desktop computers.  It's unique to the Toshiba laptop.
