So i'm trying to get my new ubuntu installation up and running. I've been trying to set up dual monitors and have them largely working. However, i've run into a problem with playing video in gxine/totem under dual monitors. The problem is that during playback the movie is stretched horizontally. I think that this is a problem due to the perceived resolution of the monitor.
When I use the gnome "preferences->screen resolution" app, it reports that my resolution is 3200x1200. If I change this to 1600x1200 it fixes the movie playback, but breaks the dual monitors. 

My guess is that I need to somehow force a screen resolution in gxine, or get a proper dual monitor setup.

I'm running ubuntu dapper, i'm trying to use a 1600x1200 lcd with a 17 inch crt on an ati card using the ati drivers. i have been playing with aticonfig. my xorg.conf file is below.
