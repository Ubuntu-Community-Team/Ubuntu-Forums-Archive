I'm not finding anything on this.  If I try to log in with my username on my non-x terminal (eg tty1), I get the error > Cannot execute bash: No such file or directory  
However, I *can* log in as root just fine, except that I do get one message on log in saying > -bash: alias: 'rxvt': invalid alias name  
Also, bash does work for my username- if I go to the gnome terminal and open up a shell I don't seem to get any errors. /bin/bash is there, and bash *is* my shell (according to the SHELL env variable).  
This does not seem to be a permissions issue.  My only thought is that something is funny in my .bashrc or .profile file, or somehwere else I'm aliasing the 'bash' command oddly, but I don't see anything yet.  Where else does linux read through and find aliases when you log in?

Post your ~/.bashrc file.

Hmm.  Let's have a look at these too:

```

/root/.bashrc
/root/.profile
~/.profile
/etc/profile
/etc/bash.bashrc
```

I just don't get it.  All those files are fine.  :-(

well, I finally figured this out.  Somehow the default shell for me in /etc/passwd was "bash", not "/bin/bash", so I changed this and it was fine.  Thinking back, I did once mess with changing my default shell because a program I installed required the c shell.  When I changed back, I must have typed "chsh -s bash", instead of "chsh -s /bin/bash".

There are a couple of clues I should've seen to figure this out earlier: first was obvious but (for me) easy to overlook, the SHELL env variable was just "bash"; it's supposed to be "/bin/bash". Second, the problem was only with login shells (not interactive shells).  When I finally figured out the difference between those types of login shells was when I started on the path to actually sorting this out.

Anyone like me who are completely newbee and don't know how to change /etc/passwd file when not able to login as su. Command is sudo <shell_name> and your user password.
After one hour of googling I found it.
