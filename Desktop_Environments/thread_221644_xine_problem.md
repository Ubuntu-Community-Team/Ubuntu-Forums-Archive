hi
i have instaled xine, codecs and dvd support in the way it is suggested on ubuntuguide.org. 
my dma is on too.

however when i play dvd-s they don't go smoothly,but as some kind of slideshow... 

when i type xine check, it shows me this:

Please be patient, this script may take a while to run...
[ good ] you're using Linux, doing specific tests
[ good ] looks like you have a /proc filesystem mounted.
[ good ] You seem to have a reasonable kernel version (2.6.15-23-386)
[ good ] intel compatible processor, checking MTRR support
[ good ] you have MTRR support and there are some ranges set.
[ good ] found the player at /usr/bin/xine
[ hint ] multiple xine executables found in your PATH
         I have found more than one occurance of 'xine' in your PATH:
         /usr/bin/X11/xine
         /usr/bin/xine
         You have probably installed xine-ui more than once, or the directory
         where you have installed xine occurs more than once in your PATH.
         Technically, this is not really a problem, but it's probably
         somewhat confusing, as it's not obvious, which xine you're using.
         You should probably uninstall the copies that you don't use...
         Further tests assume, you're using /usr/bin/X11/xine
         press <enter> to continue...

[OUCH!!] no xine-config on this machine.
         This means that xine-lib is either not installed
         or it is installed in a very unusual place.
         So you should probably install xine-lib before running xine-check...
         press <enter> to continue...

[ hint ] unable to determine plugin directory
         I could not determine your plugin directory. That would be much easier
         if you had xine-config installed (see message above)...
         Note that I could not check your xine plugins.
         press <enter> to continue...

[ good ] /dev/cdrom points to /dev/hda
[ good ] /dev/dvd points to /dev/hda
[ good ] DMA is enabled for your DVD drive
[ good ] found xvinfo: X-Video Extension version 2.2
[ hint ] Your X server doesn't support YV12 overlays.
         That means xine will have to do color space transformation and scaling
         in software, which is quite CPU intensive. Maybe upgrading your
         X server will help here.
         If you have an ATI card, you'll find accelerated X servers on
         [http://www.linuxvideo.org/gatos/](http://www.linuxvideo.org/gatos/)

[ hint ] Your X server doesn't have any XVideo support...
         XVideo is an X server extension introduced by XFree86 4.x. This
         extension provides access to hardware accelerated color space
         conversion and scaling, which gives a great performance boost.
         If you have a fast (>1GHz) machine, you may be able to watch all
         kinds of video, anyway. You will waste lots of CPU cycles, though...

I have the same problem, but no one seem to have a solution.
