Upon running synaptic I get the error "couldn't stat source package list [http://archive.ubuntu.com](http://archive.ubuntu.com) breezy/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/" and a few more similiar errors. Also when downloading package info it takes quite some time. It seems to be downloading the same package info every time?

The "stat" errors are usually solved by clicking "Reload"; have you tried this, yet?

Yes and it does load the package info but its a 4MB+ download every time.

Yet another "woah what the hell?" for me. These past 2-3 days has been nothing but a pain for me and ubuntu. This is starting to look like the problems i had with Xandros and the "broken packages"
