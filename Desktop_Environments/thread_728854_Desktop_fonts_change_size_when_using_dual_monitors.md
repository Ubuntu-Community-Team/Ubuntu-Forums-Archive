title: "Desktop fonts change size when using dual monitors"

### Post by muadnu on 2008-03-19
I've been having this problem since installing gutsy. I have a Dell Vostro 1400, with an Nvidia 8400 GS card in it, so I use twinview for my dual monitor settings (with gnome).

When I connect my external monitor at home, the desktop fonts (under the icons in the desktop, in the windows titles, in conky, and even the ones I used in emacs) change size. They are smaller when I connect the external monitor (they shrink, I'd say, by 1 point). This is just a visual effect, the settings obviously remain the same. But it is somehow annoying. For instance, my conky configuration works well for the smaller fonts, but not the bigger ones.

Here's my xorg file in case it helps...
