I ran apt-get update and i still have a slew of errors.  Any help to clean this up would be appreciated
```

W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems
E: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.

I got (what looks like) the exact same errors, and being a noob, I resorted to the ever-so-helpful restart! Anyway.. it actually got rid of the errors.

I did the same, but here the restart isn't so all powerfull...=-|

The only way for me to get rid of these horrors... errors was to disable universe and multiverse, refresh the lists, enable them again, repeat that a few dozen times and then that messages disappeared. Forever, I hope (yeah, right)...

Blasphemous as it may sound, things like this make me miss windowsupdate sometimes...
