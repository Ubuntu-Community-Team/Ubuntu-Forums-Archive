you are probably using the gconf as backend. Many people have had problems using gconf.

Go to CCSM. Then click Preferences on the left navigation menu. In the Backend section, select Flat File and close. Then restart compiz by pressing 

Alt + F2 ...This will bring up a run dialog, type in ```
compiz --replace
```If you also have installed emerald and want to start emerald too then type in ```
emerald --replace
```or if you have installed the fusion-icon, then type in ```
fusion-icon
```You should always start compiz by using the run dialog and not the terminal

Looks like the same error to me except that the Gconf errors at the bottom of your first post are gone now.

I am not sure about the ccp.xml. Maybe someone else could help you out.
