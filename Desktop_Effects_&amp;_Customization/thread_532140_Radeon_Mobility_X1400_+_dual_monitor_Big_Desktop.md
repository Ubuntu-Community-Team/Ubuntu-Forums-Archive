### Post by rgiskard01 on 2007-08-22
I have a Thinkpad T60 with an ATI Radeon Mobility X1400 card running the fglrx driver and am trying to setup dual monitors.  My second monitor is an IBM Thinkvision 21" LCD.    I currently have it mirrored, but I want to have the Big Desktop, yet have been unable no matter what I try to get it working.  

>fglrxinfo:
display: :0.0  screen: 0
OpenGL vendor string: ATI Technologies Inc.
OpenGL renderer string: ATI Mobility Radeon X1400
OpenGL version string: 2.0.6334 (8.34.8)

Has anyone got this working with the X1400 cards?
