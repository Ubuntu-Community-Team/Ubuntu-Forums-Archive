Stop at the "ATI Radeon X1600XT" part of your post. 

Ubuntu and Linux in general does not like Canadian graphics for some reason; Canadians apparently dont like Linux either because they refuse to release graphic drivers that support features needed by Beryl to work properly. I'm stuck in the same boat as you, I have an 1900xt and cant run Beryl either.

If your serious about using Beryl your going to have to sell the Canadian hardware and buy something American (nVidia product). Id recommend the 6800 series or newer for the best graphics performance....

I do have a x9600 and about the same problem. Well i don't know if i should use AIGLX or XGL i have tried the AIGLX and i have the composite exstensions in my xorg.conf Enabled it tells me that i dont have 3d. 
glxinfo | grep direct
Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
direct rendering: No
OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
and my fglrx tells me this:
Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
display: :0.0  screen: 0
OpenGL vendor string: Mesa project: [www.mesa3d.org](www.mesa3d.org)
OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
OpenGL version string: 1.4 (1.5 Mesa 6.5.2)

Well if i use the composite extension Disable it all shows to be good but then beryl stops at the piont where it is cheking for it 
Checking for XComposite extension               : failed

Don't know if it will help but maby try playing around whit the XGL or the AIGLX could help
at least that is what i will do
