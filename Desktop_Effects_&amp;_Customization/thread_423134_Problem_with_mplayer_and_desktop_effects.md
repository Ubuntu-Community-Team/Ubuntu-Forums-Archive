### Post by lbyrd33 on 2007-04-25
I just installed feisty on a new computer and I am having problems with getting my mplayer firefox plugin to go fullscreen and getting the desktop effects. I am not sure if these are related. When starting desktop effects it says my composite function is not available so I enabled it on my xorg file, but it still does not work after restarting. I have a ATI radeon express 1100 video card which I had to enable restricted drivers to get working. Running the command glxgears shows that I no longer have 3D acceleration after changing my xorg file to enabling the composite function. I am posting my xorg file and my mplayer plugin file. Any help on this situation would be greatly appreciated.

I just changed the last line of my xorg file to that below and I now again have 3D acceleration. Still though desktop effects and beryl do not work.

Disregard the mplayer question as I just had to change the video output to x11.
