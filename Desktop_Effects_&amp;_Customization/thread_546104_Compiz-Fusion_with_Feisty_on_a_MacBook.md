### Post by PaulFXH on 2007-09-08
I'm running Feisty on a MacBook (2.16 GHz, 1GB RAM, Integrated Intel 945GM graphics) and it runs very well. However, I can't get CF working with Ubuntu.
Now, Beryl runs fine (as does compiz). In addition, I have CF working perfectly on the same computer under Sidux 2007-3
I installed CF from [here]("http://forlong.blogage.de/article/2007/8/26/The-best-way-to-install-Compiz-Fusion-on-Ubuntu-Feisty") and I followed this [guide]("http://wiki.opencompositing.org/Intel_with_AiGLX") (as well as the equivalent file in Sidux) to modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf
When I start CF using this command
```
LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 INTEL_BATCH=1 compiz --replace --indirect-rendering --sm-disable ccp &
```
I get this in the terminal
```

/usr/bin/compiz.real (video) - Warn: No 8 bit GLX pixmap format, disabling YV12 image format

```
but no 3D effects whasoever are available.


I believe that whatever problem is there is in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file so I append this below. 
I would welcome any comments.
