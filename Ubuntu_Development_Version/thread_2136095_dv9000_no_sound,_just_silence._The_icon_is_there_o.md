from a forum thread, tried this and now have sound.
I ALSO HAD TO slide the volume slider from the middle position up to hear the sound. so I had not moved the slider earlier. Maybe that was it?
I would have thought the middle slider position would have yielded sound?


> I entered this script and it worked:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/ppa; sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get install pavucontrol linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm ubuntu-desktop linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; sudo apt-get -y --reinstall install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm ubuntu-desktop linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*; sudo usermod -aG `cat /etc/group | grep -e '^pulse:' -e '^audio:' -e '^pulse-access:' -e '^pulse-rt:' -e '^video:' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's:,$::g'` `whoami`

uh, whoami??

YET, there is still no microphone available under input, so still not correct.?
However slide the slider up some more, and it responds as a microphone, so who knows. Just does not say microphone.
Called 'Analog input'
